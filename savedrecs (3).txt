AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualistic, symbiotic associations with the roots of more than 80% of land plants(1). The fungi are incapable of completing their life cycle in the absence of a host root. Their spores can germinate and grow in the absence of a host, but their hyphal growth is very limited. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern signalling and recognition between AM fungi and their host plants. In one of the first stages of host recognition, the hyphae of AM fungi show extensive branching in the vicinity of host roots before formation of the appressorium(2-4), the structure used to penetrate the plant root. Host roots are known to release signalling molecules that trigger hyphal branching(5-7), but these branching factors have not been isolated. Here we have isolated a branching factor from the root exudates of Lotus japonicus and used spectroscopic analysis and chemical synthesis to identify it as a strigolactone, 5-deoxy-strigol. Strigolactones are a group of sesquiterpene lactones, previously isolated as seed-germination stimulants for the parasitic weeds Striga and Orobanche(8). The natural strigolactones 5-deoxy-strigol, sorgolactone and strigol, and a synthetic analogue, GR24, induced extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the AM fungus Gigaspora margarita at very low concentrations.

AB Plant growth promoting microorganisms (PGPM) and biological control agents (BCA) are shown to possess secondary beneficial effects that would increase their usefulness as bio-inoculants, regardless of the need for their primary function. Indeed, PGPM, such as Rhizobium and Glomus spp., can promote plant growth and productivity (primary effect) but have now been shown to also play a role in reducing disease (secondary effect). Conversely, BCA, such as Trichoderma and Pseudomonas spp., can control disease (primary effect) but have recently demonstrated stimulation of plant growth (secondary effect) in the absence of a pathogen. Further work shedding light onto the precise mode of action and ecophysiology of these microorganisms would assist with their timely and appropriate use and potentially unleash their full promise as beneficial rhizosphere bio-inoculants for improved growth and health of plants. The potential increased use of these microorganisms afforded by their multifaceted beneficial effects may further help in reducing problems associated with the use of synthetic chemicals in agriculture.

DE Economic analysis; Vegetables; Aquaponics; Hydroponics
AB The UVI Commercial Aquaponic System is designed to produce fish and vegetables in a recirculating aquaculture system. The integration of these systems intensifies production in a small land area, conserves water, reduces waste discharged into the environment, and recovers nutrients from fish production into valuable vegetable crops. A standard protocol has been developed for the production of tilapia yielding 5 MT per annum. The production of many vegetable crops has also been studied but, because of specific growth patterns and differences of marketable product, no single protocol can be promoted. Each crop yields different value per unit area and this must be considered when selecting varieties to produce to provide the highest returns to the farmer. Variables influencing the value of a crop are density (plants/m(2)), yield (unit or kg), production period (weeks) and unit value ($). Combining these variables to one unit, $/m(2)/week, provides a common point for comparison among crops. Farmers can focus production efforts on the most valuable crops or continue to produce a variety of crops meeting market demand with the knowledge that each does not contribute equally to profitability.

AB As the processes facilitated by plant growth promoting microorganisms (PGPMs) become better characterized, it is evident that PGPMs may be critical for successful sustainable agricultural practices. Microbes enrich plant growth through various mechanisms, such as enhancing resistance to disease and drought, producing beneficial molecules, and supplying nutrients and trace metals to the plant rhizosphere. Previous studies of PGPMs have focused primarily on soil-based crops. In contrast, aquaponics is a water-based agricultural system, in which production relies upon internal nutrient recycling to co-cultivate plants with fish. This arrangement has management benefits compared to soil-based agriculture, as system components may be designed to directly harness microbial processes that make nutrients bioavailable to plants in downstream components. However, aquaponic systems also present unique management challenges. Microbes may compete with plants for certain micronutrients, such as iron, which makes exogenous supplementation necessary, adding production cost and process complexity, and limiting profitability and system sustainability. Research on PGPMs in aquaponic systems currently lags behind traditional agricultural systems, however, it is clear that certain parallels in nutrient use and plant-microbe interactions are retained from soil-based agricultural systems.

AB Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are unique engineered ecosystems that minimize environmental perturbation by reducing nutrient pollution discharge. RAS typically employ a biofilter to control ammonia levels produced as a byproduct of fish protein catabolism. Nitrosomonas (ammonia-oxidizing), Nitrospira, and Nitrobacter (nitrite-oxidizing) species are thought to be the primary nitrifiers present in RAS biofilters. We explored this assertion by characterizing the biofilter bacterial and archaeal community of a commercial scale freshwater RAS that has been in operation for >15 years. We found the biofilter community harbored a diverse array of bacterial taxa (>1000 genus-level taxon assignments) dominated by Chitinophagaceae (similar to 12%) and Acidobacteria (similar to 9%). The bacterial community exhibited significant composition shifts with changes in biofilter depth and in conjunction with operational changes across a fish rearing cycle. Archaea also were abundant, and were comprised solely of a low diversity assemblage of Thaumarchaeota (>95%), thought to be ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) from the presence of AOA ammonia monooxygenase genes. Nitrosomonas were present at all depths and time points. However, their abundance was orders of magnitude less than AOA and exhibited significant depth-time variability not observed for AOA. Phylogenetic analysis of the nitrite oxidoreductase beta subunit (nxrB) gene indicated two distinct Nitrospira populations were present, while Nitrobacter were not detected. Subsequent identification of Nitrospira ammonia monooxygenase alpha subunit genes in conjunction with the phylogenetic placement and quantification of the nxrB genotypes suggests complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox) and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira populations co-exist with relatively equivalent and stable abundances in this system. It appears RAS biofilters harbor complex microbial communities whose composition can be affected directly by typical system operations while supporting multiple ammonia oxidation lifestyles within the nitrifying consortium.

AB Nitrospira and Nitrobacter are nitrite-oxidising bacteria commonly identified in nitrogen removal wastewater treatment plants. Little is known about the growth parameters of Nitrospira or the effects of environmental conditions or inhibitory compounds on Nitrospira activity. These bacterial properties were investigated using an enriched Nitrospira culture and an enriched Nitrobacter culture or Nitrobacter literature values. Compared to Nitrobacter, Nitrospira was found to have a comparable optimal PH range (8.0-8.3); similar normalised activity-temperature relationship (0.44e(0.055(T-15))) for temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C and a similar oxygen half-saturation constant, K-O (0.54 +/- 0.14 mgL(-1)). The major differences identified were that Nitrospira had a lower nitrite half-saturation constant, Ks (0.9 +/- 0.07 mgNO(2)-NL-1); lower inhibition threshold concentrations for free ammonia (between 0.04 and 0.08 mgNH(3)-N L-1) and free nitrous acid (less than 0.03 mg HNO2-N L-1) and a higher yield (0.15 +/- 0.04gVSS g N-1). Therefore, Nitrospira is more likely to dominate nitrite oxidation under conditions with low ammonium and nitrite concentrations, which would provide an advantage to them due to their lower Ks value while avoiding any free ammonia or free nitrous acid inhibition.

AB Aquaculture has been on the frontline of public concerns regarding sustainability. Sustainable farming is the farming of the new millennium. Aquaponics is essentially the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, and it fits very well in the therm,,sustainable production technolgy" The aim of this study was to assess the quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) production obtained in an integrated aquaponic system with recirculating aquaculture system of pikeperch growing. The fish was breaded in recirculating system. The plants were cultivated in the aquaponic module. Fish species used was represented by pikeperch (Sander lucioperca). Biological plant material used in the experiments was represented by lettuce, Lactuca sativa, variety White Boston. Chemical analyses concerning phosphorus level in plants were carried out over a number of 5 plants in Repetition 1, 5 plants in Repetition 2 and 5 plants in Control Version. Phosphorus was determined in the form of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5). Determination of phosphorus was made by dosage in 2% acetic acid from plant material, followed by colorimetric determination of phosphorus. The differences between P2O5 levels from the salad aquaponically produced and P2O5 levels in salad conventionally produced in natural conditions are statistically significant (p<0.001). P2O5 levels from the salad aquaponically produced are higher.

AB Humic and lactic acids were added to the nutrient solution supplied to tomato plants grown hydroponically at suboptimal pH values and suboptimal electric conductivity (EC). Humic acid was applied in the form of sodium humate, and lactic acid was applied as lactate (LACTOFOL). Humic acid and lactic acid produced specific effects at different pH and EC values. Humic acid improved plant growth when the EC was very high. When humic acid was applied by watering the substrate, shoot and root dry matter and root length were greatest at the optimal pH (5.8). In almost all experiments with pH between 4.5 and 7.5 growth was generally better when lactic acid was added to the nutrient solution. Lactic acid was particularly effective in high pH solutions. In some cases the development of tomato plants was also enhanced by combinations of humic acid, lactic acid and/or inoculation with spore suspensions of Bacillus subtilis.

AB Aquaponics, producing fish and vegetables in a closed-loop water system, reduces fertilizer use and water discharge, and is therefore promoted as a sustainable venture. A recent global study found that the majority of 257 surveyed aquaponics farms made losses, but the reasons have been poorly analyzed. Based upon grey literature and a post-hoc cost-benefit analysis for an investment in an aquaponics farm in the Philippines, this paper aims to assess the factors contributing to an appropriate level of returns. In the Philippines, vegetables are relatively well-priced, but if catfish were produced, a venture producing 1250 kg fish, 6000 kg lettuce, and 300 kg tomato per year would have a Net-Benefit-Cost Ratio of below 1.3 after 20 years. This ratio should be higher when one considers the risks against which a farmer cannot and should not insure its production, as argued in the paper. Depending on the species of both fish and vegetables, the quantity of nutrients coming from the former component imposes a fish volume: vegetable area ratio ranging from 1:30 to 1:100, thus the quantity of marketable fresh vegetables determines the size of an aquaponics enterprise. As a consequence, the investments in the fish component are relatively high and weigh heavily on the financial balance. For producers to successfully adopt aquaponics, they need to consider starting first with catfish, and then, as they get to master the system's management, they can shift to a high-value fish species for niche markets.

AB Salt-tolerant plants can be used as biofilters for nutrient-rich saline water such as aquaculture process water. Tripolium pannonicum (Jacq.) Dobrocz. was used to determine optimal culturing conditions for an efficient biofilter performance in terms of nutrient recycling by plant uptake. This performance was evaluated by taking different parameters into account, such as biomass production, plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake as well as physiological parameters and decrease of nitrate-N and phosphate-P concentrations in the experimental fluid. Afterwards, additional plant species known as edible were studied to follow the idea of generating valuable co-products beside the use as biofilter. It was shown that a nitrate-N concentration of at least 10 mg l(-1) is necessary for reasonable biomass production. A phosphate-P concentration of 0.3 mg l(-1) is sufficient, but higher concentrations promote the uptake of phosphate-P. The addition of iron in chelated form is required for the growth of healthy plant biomass; the addition of manganese is beneficial but not implicitly necessary. Salt concentrations lower than seawater salinity promote biomass production and nutrient uptake. The use of a hydroponic culture system is more suitable than sand or expanded clay culture if controlled conditions and nutrient recycling are desired. The five weeks experiment to compare different halophyte species in 0.24 m(2) tanks with nine plants each resulted in above ground fresh weight of 185 to 398 g and total uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus of 0.6 to 2.1 g and 0.1 to 0.4g, respectively. All tested species have potential to serve as biofilter and source for valuable co-products. A promising application is the growth of halophytic vegetable plants in marine aquaponic systems.

AB The effects of humic acids (HA) isolated from seven different Oxisols from Brazilian tropical and subtropical regions on root growth of maize seedlings were investigated. The HA were characterized by elemental composition, C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (C-13 cross-polarization magic angle spinning-NMR), diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy, and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The HA differed in hydrophobicity and molecular dimension of their alkyl, carbohydrate-like, and aromatic C components. Changes in plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity and expression in root cells were considered physiological markers of HA bioactivity. All HA promoted root growth and proton pump activation in maize vesicles. Maize plants treated for 7 days with 20 mg C HA L-1 increased adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis from 72% to 392%, and H+-ATPase expression from 111% to 495%. Within a general stimulation of root areas over control, some HA preferentially increased root length, whereas others enhanced root density. Root growth enhancement was significantly correlated to HA hydrophobicity. Although acting synergistically with hydrophobicity, the relationship to bioactivity of HA apparent molecular size and carbon content was of a lesser significance. The conformational dynamics of humic hydrophobic associations in the rhizosphere may release auxin-like plant growth promoters and actively enhance plants' biochemical activities.

AB Atmospheric reactions and slow geological processes controlled Earth's earliest nitrogen cycle, and by similar to 2.7 billion years ago, a linked suite of microbial processes evolved to form the modern nitrogen cycle with robust natural feedbacks and controls. Over the past century, however, the development of new agricultural practices to satisfy a growing global demand for food has drastically disrupted the nitrogen cycle. This has led to extensive eutrophication of fresh waters and coastal zones as well as increased inventories of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Microbial processes will ultimately restore balance to the nitrogen cycle, but the damage done by humans to the nitrogen economy of the planet will persist for decades, possibly centuries, if active intervention and careful management strategies are not initiated.

AB Aquacultural effluents are rich in P, a growing concern worldwide for potential environmental pollution. Thus integrating aquaculture with agriculture, e.g. aquaponics, shows promise to enhance nutrient and water use efficiency and overall environmental sustainability. The present study was carried out to quantify a P flow, P mass balance, and evaluate P removal efficiency by hydroponic lettuce integrated with tilapia aquaculture. Also, a phosphorus dynamics simulation model was developed to be a decision support system for phosphorus management. 15 tilapia juveniles (20 g) and four 15-day-old lettuce seedlings comprised each aquaponics experimental unit (n = 3). At days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after transplanting, water samples were taken from each aquaponics biofilter to determine the reactive and total concentration of phosphorus. The P dynamics model was validated by comparing predicted to observed values of dissolved P over time. The linear regression equations between predicted and measured values were compared with the 1:1 line for statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in slope and intercept values. The adequacy of the model was determined by testing if intercept equals zero and slope equals one separately using the one sample Student t-test. Comparison of simulated and measured values of dissolved P dynamics showed a good fit around the 1:1 line with the slope (b = 1.005) and intercept values (a = 0.0189) being not statistically different (p > 0.05) from 1.0 and 0, respectively. The assimilation of Pin the fish and plant components comprised 71.7% of the total P input, indicating high P utilization by the system. The P dynamics model predicted the behavior of dissolved phosphorus in aquaponics systems, which can be used to determine adequate fish:plant ratios, maximize P use efficiency and minimize waste. The overall high P utilization by fish and plants identified in this study showed that aquaponics is an excellent tool for recycling phosphorus while yielding a high-quality crop.

AB Phytase is a phosphatase enzyme used as dietary supplement when significant portions of plant-based ingredients are used in fish feed formulations. This work thus assessed the effects of a phytase-supplemented diet on the P dynamics, P availability, P budget, fish and plant growth parameters, and carcass composition of Nile tilapia and phosphorus content of lettuce plants in aquaponic systems. The diet supplemented with phytase at the concentration of 1000 FTU kg(-1) showed a significant increase in released phosphorus compared to the control in an in vitro assay. Phytase supplementation increased accumulation of phosphorus in fish carcass compared to the control, but did not affect growth performance. The addition of phytase to fish diets improved phosphorus utilization by fish, reducing phosphorus excretion. The lower amount of phosphorus excreted in the water caused by phytase did not impair the growth or phosphorus content of lettuce grown using the aquaponic nutrient solution. It is recommended that, even though the use of phytase in fish feeds increased the overall utilization of phosphorus in the present study, a small portion of inorganic phosphorus must be supplemented to meet minimum fish requirements.

AB Plant growth promoters (PGP) are microorganisms essential for sustainable food production systems by improving the productivity of crops and mitigating environmental impacts. Microorganisms enhance the P availability to plants by mineralizing organic P and solubilizing precipitated phosphates. This work is focused on the effect of inoculation of a commercial product containing a mixture of Bacillus spp. on hydroponically grown lettuce (Lactuca sativa) integrated with tilapia (Orechromis niloticus) aquaculture in a closed-loop system, in comparison with an untreated control. We determined plant growth and crop quality parameters to assess the efficacy of the beneficial microorganisms. A nutrient dynamics analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of Bacillus inoculation on the changes of nutrient concentration in aquaponics solutions, as well as the phosphorus accumulation in several components (fish, plants, water and solids). We performed a plate-count assay to quantify the number microorganisms present in systems inoculated or not with the commercial Bacillus mixture. In general, nutrient dynamics was affected by the inclusion of the Bacillus mixture in the water. Systems that received the product showed faster decreases in ammonia concentration and faster increase in nitrite and nitrate concentrations than the control. The untreated aquaponics systems showed lower accumulation of phosphorus in the water than systems receiving the Bacillus mixture, which resulted in poor plant growth, low phosphorus accumulation in the leaves and low chlorophyll content. However, the mass balance analysis showed that an external source of phosphorus possibly contributed to the overall P budget in systems receiving the Bacillus mixture. The microbial plate count assay demonstrated an active microbiota in aquaponics systems receiving the treatment while untreated systems showed zero microbial counts. The Bacillus mixture used in the present study appears to have PGP properties and to affect P dynamics in aquaponics systems. However, since the product contained traces of phosphorus in its composition, further analysis will be necessary to distinguish whether the advantageous effects promoted by the Bacillus occurred as a result of a beneficial microbial activity or a fertilizing effect.

AB The effects of the nutrient solution oxygenation on the growth of tomato plants and colonization of plant roots by Pythium F707, an isolate with filamentous non-inflated sporangia, were investigated under hydroponic conditions. Lipoperoxidation was also estimated determining lipoxygenase activity and conjugated dienes. Tomato plants were grown under either a high (11-14%; Air treatment), a moderate (5.8-7%; Control) or a low (0.8-1.5%; Nitrogen treatment) oxygen concentration and inoculated or not with the pathogen. The high oxygen treatment resulted in a marked increase in plant growth, as measured by shoot and root weights. Root and top weights were about the same in the nitrogen-treated plants and the controls. In these treatments, plants started showing typical symptoms of root decay and infection within 6 days after inoculation with Pythium F, while highly oxygenated plants remained healthy throughout the experiment and showed a significant decrease in root colonization by the pathogen, as estimated by the immunoenzymatic staining procedure and isolation of thalles on selective medium. Nitrogen-treated plants and controls produced higher amounts of conjugated dienes and revealed increased lipoxygenase activities in comparison with highly oxygenated plants. These differences were more pronounced after inoculation with the pathogen. Our data suggest that increases in lipoxygenase activity detected in the present study in tomato roots grown under oxygen stress and inoculated with Pythium F may lead to degradation and disorganization of membrane lipids. That disorganization may facilitate root colonization by the pathogen and appearance of decay.

AB Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been considered to be a two-step process catalysed by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms oxidizing either ammonia or nitrite. No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities.

DT Article
ID IPOMOEA-AQUATICA; QUALITY
AB Aquaponics is an integrated fish and plant recirculating production system. The University of the Virgin Islands' raft aquaponic system uses a cylindro-conical clarifier as a primary solids removal device; however, a swirl separator may offer advantages. The objectives of the 8-wk experiment were to compare water quality parameters, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, production and water spinach, Ipomoea aquatica, production in a raft aquaponic system using a clarifier or swirl separator for primary treatment of solids in the waste stream. No significant differences (P0.05) existed between treatments for temperature, oxygen, pH, total suspended solids, alkalinity, electrical conductivity, total ammonia-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, macronutrients, and micronutrients concentrations in the culture water. There were no significant differences (P0.05) between treatments for Nile tilapia production, average weight, survival, or feed conversion ratio. There were no significant differences (P0.05) between treatments for water spinach production or plant tissue analysis. In conclusion, the swirl separator used in this experiment performed similar to the clarifier and water spinach grew vigorously in the raft aquaponic system.

AB Plant growth performance is optimized under hydroponic conditions. The comparison between aquaponics and hydroponics has attracted considerable attention recently, particularly regarding plant yield. However, previous research has not focused on the potential of using aquaponic solution complemented with mineral elements to commercial hydroponic levels in order to increase yield. For this purpose, lettuce plants were put into AeroFlo installations and exposed to hydroponic (HP), aquaponic (AP), or complemented aquaponic (CAP) solutions. The principal finding of this research was that AP and HP treatments exhibited similar (p > 0.05) plant growth, whereas the shoot weight of the CAP treatment showed a significant (p < 0.05) growth rate increase of 39% on average compared to the HP and AP treatments. Additionally, the root weight was similar (p > 0.05) in AP and CAP treatments, and both were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that observed in the HP treatment. The results highlight the beneficial effect of recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) water on plant growth. The findings represent a further step toward developing decoupled aquaponic systems (i.e., two-or multi-loops) that have the potential to establish a more productive alternative to hydroponic systems. Microorganisms and dissolved organic matter are suspected to play an important role in RAS water for promoting plant roots and shoots growth.

ID ACIDIFICATION
AB On the basis of the FAO projection 'World Agriculture: Towards 2015/2030' we direct our discussion to food production, the consequences for land use, efficiency of nitrogen (N) and losses of reactive N to the environment during 1995-2030. According the FAO, global food production can keep pace with the increase in food demand in the coming three decades. However, according the projection used here, there will be a major global increase (8%) in arable land, most of it in developing countries and with a major impact on the extent of tropical forests. Further forest clearing may occur to compensate for declining soil productivity due to land degradation. Despite improvements in the N use efficiency, total reactive N loss will grow strongly in the world's increasingly intensive agricultural systems. In the 1995-2030 period emissions of reactive N from intensive agricultural systems will continue to rise, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the increase of N use efficiency and further improvement of agronomic management must remain high on the priority list of policy makers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growths of the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) and water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) were evaluated in recirculation aquaponic system (RAS). Fish production performance, plant growth and nutrient removal were measured and their dependence on hydraulic loading rate (HLR) was assessed. Fish production did not differ significantly between hydraulic loading rates. In contrast to the fish production, the water spinach yield was significantly higher in the lower hydraulic loading rate. Fish production, plant growth and percentage nutrient removal were highest at hydraulic loading rate of 1.28 m/day. The ratio of fish to plant production has been calculated to balance nutrient generation from fish with nutrient removal by plants and the optimum ratio was 15-42 gram of fish feed/m(2) of plant growing area. Each unit in RAS was evaluated in terms of oxygen demand. Using specified feeding regime. mass balance equations were applied to quantify the waste discharges from rearing tanks and treatment units. The waste discharged was found to be strongly dependent on hydraulic loading rate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aquaponics is a promising technology combining aquaculture with hydroponics. In this study, algal-bacterial consortia were introduced into aquaponics, i.e., algal-bacterial based aquaponics (AA), to improve the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of aquaponics. The results showed that the NUE of AA was 13.79% higher than that of media-based aquaponics (MA). In addition, higher NO3- removal by microalgae assimilation led to better water quality in AA, which made up for the deficiencies of poor aquaponic management of nitrate. As a result of lower NO3- concentrations and dramatically higher dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations caused by microalgae photosynthesis in the photobioreactor, the N2O emission of AA was 89.89% lower than that of MA, although nosZ gene abundance in MA's hydroponic bed was approximately 30 times over that in AA. Considering the factors mentioned above, AA would improve the sustainability of aquaponics and have a good application foreground.

AB Aquaponics is generally regarded as a sustainable practice, but its environmental burdens were not yet deeply investigated. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to assess the environmental impacts of two hypothetical coupled aquaponics systems (CAPS): Raft System (RAFT) and Media-Filled Beds System (MFBS). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were considered as cultivated species in both systems. The Simapro (R) software V.8.0 was used for calculation. The comparison between the two virtual systems indicated the floating technique as the less impacting one. Even though energy consumption appears to be higher in the floating system, LCA results were markedly influenced by the extensive use of inert materials in MFSB. In both systems, contribution analyses underlined that the main environmental impacts are related to infrastructures, electricity and fish feed. The LCA analyses carried out in this study highlights that the choice of less impacting materials, and the optimization of management practices, should be taken as priorities in order to reduce environmental impacts of this activity.

AB The essential mineral nutrient potassium (K+) is the most important inorganic cation for plants and is recognized as a limiting factor for crop yield and quality. Nonetheless, it is only partially understood how K+ contributes to plant productivity. K+ is used as a major active solute to maintain turgor and to drive irreversible and reversible changes in cell volume. K+ also plays an important role in numerous metabolic processes, for example, by serving as an essential cofactor of enzymes. Here, we provide evidence for an additional, previously unrecognized role of K+ in plant growth. By combining diverse experimental approaches with computational cell simulation, we show that K+ circulating in the phloem serves as a decentralized energy storage that can be used to overcome local energy limitations. Posttranslational modification of the phloem-expressed Arabidopsis K+ channel AKT2 taps this "potassium battery," which then efficiently assists the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in energizing the transmembrane phloem (re) loading processes.

AB Potassium is a major plant nutrient which has to be accumulated in great quantity by roots and distributed throughout the plant and within plant cells. Membrane transport of potassium can be mediated by potassium channels and secondary potassium transporters. Plant potassium transporters are present in three families of membrane proteins: the K+ uptake permeases (KT/HAK/KUP), the K+ transporter (Trk/HKT) family and the cation proton antiporters (CPA). This review will discuss the contribution of members of each family to potassium acquisition, redistribution and homeostasis. (c) 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

AB A prototype of an integrated closed system for fish-plankton aquaculture was developed in Iquitos (Peruvian Amazonia) in order to cultivate the Tiger Catfish, Pseudoplatystoma punctifer (Castelnau, 1855). This freshwater recirculating system consisted of two linked sewage tanks with an intensive rearing unit (a cage) for P. punctifer placed in the first, and with a fish-plankton trophic chain replacing the filters commonly used in clear water closed systems. Detritivorous and zooplanktivorous fishes (Loricariidae and Cichlidae), maintained without external feeding in the sewage volume, mineralized organic matter and permitted the stabilization of the phytoplankton biomass. Water exchange and organic waste discharge were not necessary. In this paper we describe the processes undertaken to equilibrate this ecosystem: first the elimination of an un-adapted spiny alga, Golenkinia sp., whose proliferation was favored by the presence of a small rotifer, Trichocerca sp., and second the control of this rotifer proliferation via the introduction of two cichlid species, Acaronia nassa Heckel, 1840 and Satanoperca jurupari Heckel, 1840, in the sewage part. This favored some development of the green algae Nannochloris sp. and Chlorella sp. At that time we took the opportunity to begin a 3-month rearing test of P. punctifer. The mean specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of P. punctifer were 1.43 and 1.27, respectively, and the global FCR, including fish in the sewage part, was 1.08. This system has proven to be suitable for growing P. punctifer juveniles out to adult, and provides several practical advantages compared with traditional recirculating clear water systems, which use a combination of mechanical and biological filters and require periodic waste removal, leading to water and organic matter losses.

AB In aquaponic systems, plants treat the water by removing the nitrogen and phosphorus resulting from the fish farm and utilize it for growth as fertilizers so it is recycled rather than being discharged and polluting the environment; to minimize adverse impact of aquaculture to the environment. In the present study, two systems were investigated using Renewable Energy System for sustainability point of view: 1) Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture, IMTA-Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) System. 2) IMTA-Floating Raft System (FRS) in comparison with traditional soil culture system. The study aims to highlight some of the technical, biological, social, and economic features of aquaponic systems in Egypt. Results showed that IMTA-FRS and IMTA-NFT systems achieved best average net income and thus were able to cover costs and achieve economic surplus capacity of 53% and 47% respectively. The ability of these two systems to withstand the burden of increased costs of production circumstances or take the risk of falling prices of fish and vegetables (risk reduction) was confirmed by the results. However, IMTA-FRS can be considered as a successes aquaponic model, that the period of recovery of invested capital less (2.17 vs. 3.34 year). Our aim was to conduct the system as a small-scale business unit providing opportunity for youth projects as it represents a national challenge for developing countries.

AB Providing both fish and plants with optimal environmental conditions is a classical problem in the field of aquaponics. Several studies have tackled this problem by decoupling fish and plant systems. However, in order to achieve both high nutrient levels for the plants and low nutrient and particulate loading in the fish tanks, suspended matter in the aquaculture component needs to be discharged and fertilizer needs to be added to the plants continuously. The present study aims to explore to what degree desalination technology could potentially be used to provide the necessary balance between the two different components based on a theoretical modelling approach using contemporary source material. We suggest how specific desalination engineering approaches can improve the nutrient balances in multi-loop aquaponics systems in order to attain optimal growth conditions for both fish and plants.

AB The mobilization of nutrients from fish sludge (i.e., feces and uneaten feed) plays a key role in optimizing the resource utilization and thus in improving the sustainability of aquaponic systems. While several studies have documented the aerobic and anaerobic digestion performance of aquaculture sludge, the impact of the digestate on plant growth has yet to be understood. The present study examines the impact of either an aerobic or an anaerobic digestion effluent on lettuce plant growth, by enriching a mixture of aquaculture and tap water with supernatants from both aerobic and anaerobic batch reactors. The lettuce plants grown in the hydroponic system supplied with supernatant from an anaerobic reactor had significantly better performance with respect to weight gain than both, those in the system where supernatant from the aerobic reactor was added, as well as the control system. It can be hypothesized that this effect was caused by the presence of NH4+ as well as dissolved organic matter, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and fungi, and humic acid, which are predominantly present in anaerobic effluents. This study should therefore be of value to researchers and practitioners wishing to further develop sludge remineralization in aquaponic systems.

AB The world is facing a number of serious problems of which population rise, climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity and food security are among the most important. Aquaponics, as a closed loop system consisting of hydroponics and aquaculture elements, could contribute to addressing these problems. However, there is a lack of quantitative research to support the development of economically feasible aquaponics systems. Although many studies have addressed some scientific aspects, there has been limited focus on commercial implementation. In this review paper, opportunities that have the potential to fill the gap between research and implementation of commercial aquaponic systems have been identified. The analysis shows that aquaponics is capable of being an important driver for the development of integrated food production systems. Arid regions suffering from water stress will particularly benefit from this technology being operated in a commercial environment.

AB This chapter describes the possibility to combine wastewater treatment in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) with the production of crop plants biomass. In an aquaponic RAS established in Waedenswil, Zurich, the potential of three crop plants was assessed to recycle nutrients from fish wastewater. A special design of trickling filters was used to provide nitrification of fish wastewater: Light-expanded clay aggregate (LECA) was filled in a layer of 30 cm in vegetable boxes, providing both surface for biofilm growth and cultivation area for crop plants. Aubergine, tomato and cucumber cultures were established in the LECA filter and nutrient removal rates calculated during 42-105 days. The highest nutrient removal rates by fruit harvest were achieved during tomato culture: over a period of >3 months, fruit production removed 0.52, 0.11 and 0.8 g m(-2) d(-1) for N, P and K in hydroponic and 0.43, 0.07 and 0.4 g m(-2) d(-1) for N, P and K in aquaponic. In aquaponic, 69% of nitrogen removal by the overall system could thus be converted into edible fruits. Plant yield in aquaponic was similar to conventional hydroponic production systems. The experiments showed that nutrient recycling is not a luxury reserved for rural areas with litlle space limitation; instead, the additionally occupied surface generates income by producing marketable goods. By converting nutrients into biomass, treating wastewater could become a profitable business.

AB Aquaculture systems generate large amounts of wastes which may constitute a beneficial amendment for horticultural crop in terms of nutrients, plant growth promoter and disease suppressiveness. This study aimed to determine (1) the nutrient value of rainbow trout farming effluents coming from two feed regimes and (2) the plant growth and disease suppressiveness effects of those fish farming effluents on tomato transplants. The effluent sludge from Skretting Orient (TM) (SO) had a higher content of P (38 vs. 32 mg L-1), K (23 vs. 11 mg L-1), N (19 vs. to 11 mg NO3 L-(1); 186 vs. 123 mg NH4 L-1), and a higher NO3:NH4 ratio (1: 9 vs. 1: 13) compared with the Martin Classic (MC), while MC was richer in Mg (42 vs. 24 mg L-1) and Ca (217 vs. 169 mg L-1). For the first trial, a stimulating effect of the fish effluent was observed on plant height, leaf area and root dry biomass, while only the root biomass was increased during the second trial. Fish sludge was rich in microorganisms (97 and 142 mu g fluorescein h(-1) mL(-1) for SO and MC, respectively) and their ability to suppress Pythium ultimum Trow and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Sacc.) Snyder & Hansen was observed. Both crude fish effluents reduced in vitro mycelial growth of P. ultimum and F. oxysporum, by 100 and 32%, respectively, whileMCeffluents showed a higher inhibition against F. oxysporum. When fish effluents were sterilized by filtration or autoclaving, lower in vitro inhibition of P. ultimum and F. oxysporum was observed. Mixed fish effluents reduced tomato plant root colonization by P. ultimum (by up to 5.7-fold) and F. oxysporum (by up to 2.1-fold). These results showed that fish effluent can be used as soil amendments to promote plant growth and increase soil suppressiveness, which in turn can prevent soil-borne diseases.

AB The mechanism by which humic substances stimulate plant biological activities is not clear. To study effects of humic acid on N metabolism and growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativaL.) a hydroponic experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions. Humic acid (HA) at 0, 100, or 1000 mg∙L1was added with a nutrient solution to plants. HA accelerated uptake of N and NO3and accelerated N metabolism by enhancing nitrate reductase activity, which resulted in production of protein. HA did not affect P absorption and proline content of leaves. The photosynthetic activity of lettuce increased with all levels of HA due to enhancement of chlorophyll content and mesophyll conductance. HA can stimulate N metabolism and photosynthesis activity of lettuce to improve yield.

AB Nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry of aquaculture ponds is dominated by biological transformations of N added to ponds in the form of inorganic or organic fertilizers and formulated feeds. Nitrogen application in excess of pond assimilatory capacity can lead to the deterioration of water quality through the accumulation of nitrogenous compounds (e.g., ammonia and nitrite) with toxicity to fish or shrimp. Principal sources of ammonia include fish excretion and sediment flux derived from the mineralization of organic matter and molecular diffusion from reduced sediment, although cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation and atmospheric deposition are occasionally important. Principal sinks for ammonia include phytoplankton uptake and nitrification. The magnitude of losses by ammonia volatilization and ammonium fixation to cation exchange sites is minor, but unknown. Interactions between pond sediment and water are important regulators of N biogeochemistry. Sediment represents a source of ammonia and a sink for nitrite and nitrate. The large volume of reduced sediment suggests that the potential for N removal by denitrification is high, although the magnitude of N removal by this mechanism is low because nitrification and denitrification are tightly coupled in aquatic sediments and sediment nitrification is limited by the depth of sediment oxygen penetration. Nitrogen biogeochemistry of aquaculture ponds is affected by feeds and feeding practices, water exchange and circulation, aeration, pond depth and other management procedures. Opportunities for management of N biogeochemistry are limited and goals are based largely on the intensity of fish production. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen transformations in aquaponics with different edible plant species, i.e., tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and pak choi (Brassica campestris L. subsp. chinensis) were systematically examined and compared. Results showed that nitrogen utilization efficiencies (NUE) of tomato-and pak choi-based aquaponic systems were 41.3% and 34.4%, respectively. The abundance of nitrifying bacteria in tomato-based aquaponics was 4.2-folds higher than that in pak choi-based aquaponics, primarily due to its higher root surface area. In addition, tomato-based aquaponics had better water quality than that of pak choi-based aquaponics. About 1.5-1.9% of nitrogen input were emitted to atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N2O) in tomato-and pak choi-based aquaponic systems, respectively, suggesting that aquaponics is a potential anthropogenic source of N2O emission. Overall, this is the first intensive study that examined the role plant species played in aquaponics, which could provide new strategy in designing and operating an aquaponic system.

AB The metabolic response of the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense to nitrite toxicity was evaluated. The prawns were exposed to 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg L-1 NO2-N concentrations for 48 h. The metabolic parameters in muscle were measured after 12, 24 and 48 h. Glucose level significantly increased after 24 h. Exposure to lower nitrite concentrations (1 and 2 mg L-1) resulted in significant increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities after 24 and 48 h. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities treated with 2 and 3 mg L-1 nitrite-N at 48 h were significantly higher than those at 12 and 24 h. Intermediate sublethal nitrite concentrations produced significant elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities from 12 h up to 48 h. No significant changes were detected in any of the groups for triglycerides and creatine kinase (CK). To satisfy the increased energy demands caused by acute nitrite exposure, mobilization of lipids is not the main reason while utilization of amino acids seems to play a more important role. The results would be helpful for aquaculture farmers to prevent a potential depression of productivity caused by elevated nitrite levels.

AB Global environmental, social and economic challenges drive the need for new and improved solutions for food production and consumption. Food production within a sustainability corridor requires innovations exceeding traditional paradigms, acknowledging the complexity arising from sustainability. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how to direct further activities, to develop technologies as potential solutions for questions related to climate change, loss of soil fertility and biodiversity, scarcity of resources, and shortage of drinking water. One approach that promises to address these problems is controlled environment agriculture. Aquaponics (AP) combines two technologies: recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) and hydroponics (plant production in water, without soil) in a closed-loop system. One challenge to the development of this technology is the conversion of the toxic ammonium produced by the fish into nitrate, via bacteria in a biofilter, to provide nitrogen to the plants. However, as this Special Issue shows, there are many other challenges that need to be addressed if the goal of the technology is to contribute to more sustainable food production systems.

AB Aquaponics is a method of food production, growing fish and vegetables in a recirculating aquaculture system. Aquaponics uses the water from the fish to feed the plants in a totally natural way and like hydroponics, aquaponics is considered to be more sustainable as more plants can be grown per square metre compared to normal agriculture. However, as is the case with normal agriculture, in aquaponics plants are grown within horizontally. In aquaponics, using the UVI system, the ratio between fish tanks:filters:plant tanks is 2:1:5 which means that the plant tanks are occupying close to half of the production space. In order to reduce the spatial requirement for plants, which would make production even more sustainable, this research investigates aspects of combining living wall and vertical farming technologies in aquaponics. It is considered that by growing the plants vertically less space would be required. In this research living wall system is investigated but the main focus is on the potentials of using various inert substrates in the living wall systems for vertical aquaponics. The results showed that a pot system performs better in terms of management of the systems. With regard to substrates, horticultural grade coconut fibre and horticultural grade mineral wool outperformed other substrates.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of tomato plants to efficiently use the nitrogen (N) of a recirculation aquaponic system (RAS) and to evaluate the effects of foliar fertilization as a complement to the water nutrition on the growth of the two tomato cultivars. The significant effect of six macro- and seven micronutrients was evaluated on the plant growth and on the fruit yield. Two experiments were performed in a nutrient film aquaponic unit. The first experiment was designed to study the effects of foliar fertilization on the seedlings of two tomato cultivars Costoluto Genovese (CG) (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and Currant tomato (Ct) (Solanum pimpinellifolium) with 8% of weekly water exchange (WE8%-RAS). The foliar fertilizer was formulated with N restriction in the last 11 weeks (TF1). In the second experiment, two other foliar fertilization treatments (TF2 and TF3) were applied with a concentration of nutrients twice and triple that in TF1, but with a lower proportion of NPK ratio. These treatments were tested on the cultivar CG in a RAS with zero water exchange (WE0%-RAS). The data from the 1st experiment showed a positive effect of the foliar fertilization on the yield of both cultivars. The fertilization markedly influenced the dry matter weight of the CG; however, this effect was not observed in the Ct. The root length of both cultivars was positively influenced by the P content, whereas the plant height was affected by the excess of Co and S. According to the results from the 2nd experiment, the TF2 plants had the highest number of fruits with a high mean weight. The system was efficient in utilizing N from fish tank; the water K favored the yield of the CG fruit and the foliar K favored the growth of the TF2 plants. With a decrease in the foliar N, the CG plants were able to absorb 27.5% of the NO3- and 7.06% of total ammonia nitrogen from water. The absolute and relative growth rate of Nile tilapia was not affected by the rate of water exchange. Fulton's condition factor of the total length and weight curve indicated that fish from WE8%-RAS had wider bodies than the fish from WE0%-RAS at the same length range. Nitrate and P in the final effluent were lower than the maximum reference values allowed for the discharged water.

AB Aquaculture is globally the fastest growing sector of agriculture that needs to be sustainable and must also meet bioeconomic demands. In principle, aquaponics, the combination of aquaculture and horticulture within a single recirculating aquaponic system (SRAPS), provides a sustainable approach; however, it has lower productivity of both fish and plants in comparison to separate recirculating systems. The aim of our new concept for aquaponics is to improve sustainability and productivity concomitant with lowering environmental emissions. The aquaponic system for (nearly) emission free tomato and fish production in greenhouses (ASTAF-PRO) is a new combination of systemic parts, consisting of 2 independent recirculating units: an aquaculture system (RAS) for fish and a hydroponic unit for plants. Both systems are connected by a 1-way valve to deliver fish water containing nutrients into the hydroponic reservoir, where the fish water can be optimized as fertilizer in order to meet specific demands of the plant species. Thus, our double recirculation aquaponic system (DRAPS) can provide optimum conditions for both parts to increase productivity and to prevent any adverse interactions between plant and fish units. Water use is minimized by condensing the plant evapo-transpired water via air conditioning and returning it into the RAS. Testing of the ASTAF-PRO prototype successfully demonstrated the principle using a combination of tilapia and tomato production. Tilapia productivity was similar to single RAS, while tomato production at least indicated the potential for similar efficiency to conventional hydroponics. Thus, ASTAF-PRO improves sustainability and productivity while lowering environmental emissions, and might promote future application of aquaponics for food security.

AB The effect of juvenileNile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus, in unit I) and Common carp (Cyprinus carpio, in unit II) on plant growth (cucumber-Cucumis sativus, tomato-Solanum lycopersicum and lettuce-Lactuca sativa in co-cultivation) was investigated in two identical gravel substrate ebb-and-flood coupled aquaponic units (I, II) with 3.81 m(3) total water volume and without addition of fertiliser for 70 days. The daily extruded floating feed input of 1.2% (200 g) of initial fish biomass (16.7 kg) per unit equalled 12.0 g feed per kg fish or 52.5 g m(-3). Growth of O. niloticus (unit I) was better (p < 0.05) in final weight (57.4 g +/- 27.9), final biomass (27,683.3 g +/- 160.7), specific growth rate (0.70% d(-1) +/- 0.01) and feed conversion ratio (1.31 +/- 0.02) in comparison to C. carpio (unit II, 42.7 g +/- 22.2, 21,866.7 g +/- 568.6, 0.39% d(-1) +/- 0.02, 2.69 +/- 0.20). Tomato gross biomass was two times higher in combination with O. niloticus and tomato fruit weight was slightly higher. Plant growth in cucumber showed higher total fresh biomass in the C. carpio unit. Lettuce yield was near zero as a result of inter-specific competition. The Aquaponic Growth Factor (AGF), describing the growth performance of fish and plant combinations, was highest in tomato (1.12) combined with O. niloticus compared with C. carpio (0.53). However, the AGF of cucumber was slightly higher in combination with C. carpio (0.14) compared with O. niloticus (0.12). This study demonstrates best plant growth for the combination of O. niloticus with tomato and C. carpio with cucumber. The unit stocked with C. carpio had higher levels of oxygen (6.3 mg L-1 +/- 0.8) and oxygen saturation (78.6% +/- 8.4) in contrast to O. niloticus (5.8 mg L-1 +/- 0.8, 73.2% +/- 8.9). The long steady state of dissolved oxygen inside both units allowed a higher daily feed input of 0.3% of fish initial biomass during spring and summer seasons, 25% above the optimal feed input estimated for the same units during winter time (0.9% = 150 g). C. carpio extended the equilibrium phase during plant production before a significant oxygen drop occurred, beneficial for coupled aquaponics. Different growth performance of fish and plant combinations suggest multiple fish species use or polyponics (polyculture + aquaponics) in coupled aquaponics to increase plant yield.
   Statement of relevance: Different fish species used in identical aquaponic systems change oxygen levels and alter plant species growth. We herewith confirm this for two further fish species, and suggest combined fish species cultivation (polyponics) in coupled aquaponics to increase plant performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

AB Aquaponics is an approach of coupling two technologies: recirculation aquaculture (fish-farms) and hydroponics (soil-less cultivation of crops). While it is perceived as a way to contribute to more sustainable food systems, the technology is still in its infancy, with several challenges. This paper describes current conditions of development and identifies aspects that can promote or hinder future pathways. We focus our analysis on the EU, using Germany as an institutional case study, while also considering worldwide developments. We propose a framework to analyze aquaponics as an emerging technological innovation system at the interface between existing fish and plant production systems. The approach is explorative based on a literature review and interviews with experts. The main findings are that stakeholders have different views regarding the future development pathways, knowledge to manage complex systems in the long term is needed and it is still unclear how to design institutional conditions to deliver sustainable outcomes.

TI Potential of Producing <i>Salicornia bigelovii</i> Hydroponically as a

AB Salicornia bigelovii is a halophyte that is capable of growing under high salinity. To evaluate the potential of producing S. bigelovii hydroponically as a vegetable at moderate NaCl concentrations, plants were grown in nutrient solutions with 6, 8, and 10 mm NaCl, and with 200 mm NaCl as a control. Results showed that plants had a reduced main stem length, canopy width, stem diameter, and root system length in 6 to 10 mm NaCl compared with those in 200 mm. Also, fresh weight increase, fresh and dry weights of individual plants, marketable yield, and water use efficiency of the plants grown in solutions with 6 to 10 mm NaCl were significantly lower than those grown in 200 mm. Associated with the reduced growth attributes, remarkable decreases in sodium uptake by the plants were also obtained in 6 to 10 vs. 200 mm NaCl. The results suggest that S. bigelovii is not a good candidate for hydroponic production as a vegetable at moderate NaCl salinity resulting from reduced growth attributes, which are possibly associated with decreased sodium uptake.

AB An intensive mariculture system for the growth of sea bream has been developed which uses seaweed Ulva lactuca to remove dissolved nutrients (N and P) from the circulating water. This allows water to be safely recycled to the fish and results in a comparatively 'non-polluting' final effluent. As with other mariculture systems, only similar to 25% of the food-N was used for fish growth. The dominant processes affecting N within the system were excretion by fish of ammonia-N (30%), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) (30%) and faeces-N (10%), rapid transformation of DON to ammonia-N (16%) in the fish tank and uptake of ammonia-N (17 to 39%) by the seaweed (all percentages expressed relative to food input). Nitrification (10%) competed with the seaweed for the available ammonia-N. There was only minimal uptake of nitrate by the seaweed. Anoxic conditions developed in the sedimentation tank. Denitrification (5%) and bacterial ammonification, including sulphate reduction, were observed. The system showed only minor seasonality, probably because the major processes (food input and U, lactuca uptake) had only a slight dependence on temperature. Our quantitative understanding of the processes affecting N within the system was confirmed by a parallel study in which a computer simulation model was developed which was able to predict well the observed changes in ammonia-N, total oxidised N and U. lactuca growth. There was an excess of phosphorus in the food supplied. It was removed by the seaweed (9 to 21%) but to a lesser degree than ammonia-N. The residual organic matter in the sedimentation tank was enriched in P, probably because of the presence in the food of bone meal which is resistant to bacterial decay. The final effluent discharged contained 20 to 27% of the N supplied (and 39 to 47% of the P) which is less than half the N discharged from conventional mariculture technology.

AB Murray Cod, Maccullochella peelii peelii (Mitchell), and Green Oak lettuce, Lactuca sativa, were used to test for differences between three hydroponic subsystems, Gravel Bed, Floating Raft and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), in a freshwater Aquaponic test system, where plant nutrients were supplied from fish wastes while plants stripped nutrients from the waste water before it was returned to the fish. The Murray Cod had FCR's and biomass gains that were statistically identical in all systems. Lettuce yields were good, and in terms of biomass gain and yield, followed the relationship Gravel bed > Floating > NFT, with significant differences seen between all treatments. The NFT treatment was significantly less efficient than the other two treatments in terms of nitrate removal (20% less efficient), whilst no significant difference was seen between any test treatments in terms of phosphate removal. In terms of dissolved oxygen, water replacement and conductivity, no significant differences were observed between any test treatments. Overall, results suggest that NFT hydroponic sub-systems are less efficient at both removing nutrients from fish culture water and producing plant biomass or yield than Gravel bed or Floating hydroponic sub-systems in an Aquaponic context. Aquaponic system designers need to take these differences into account when designing hydroponic components within aquaponic systems.

AB A factorial arrangement of 6 treatments, 2 photoperiods for water spinach Ipomoea aquatica (12-h or 24-h light per day) X 3 feeding frequencies for red tilapia Oreochromis sp. (an equal daily ration evenly fed 6, 4 or 2 times at 4-h, 6-h or 12-h interval, respectively) were assigned to 12 tanks. Each tank was an aquaponics system containing fish and raft-supporting plant. Water loss in 4 weeks was 3.3%, due to leaf transpiration mainly and evaporation. Water quality remained safe and stable. No fish died. Overall average weight gain was 43.9% for fish and 169.0% for plant. 24-h light resulted in 2.4% higher fish growth, 12% higher plant growth and lower accumulation of all nitrogen and phosphate species in water than 12-h light. Increased feeding frequency favored stable and good water quality and fastened fish growth and plant growth by as much as 4.9% and 11%, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aquaponics is a form of aquaculture that integrates hydroponics to raise edible plants and fish. There is growing interest in aquaponics because it can be practiced in non-traditional locations for agriculture such as inside warehouses and on marginal lands, and it can provide locally grown products without using synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or antibiotics. Yet questions remain about the ecological and economic sustainability of aquaponics. The objective of this study was to describe the operating conditions, inputs (energy, water, and fish feed) and outputs (edible crops and fish) and their relationship over two years for a small-scale raft aquaponics operation in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The system had roughly 1% water loss per day and used an average of 35,950 L for replenishment per year. Predicted values suggest rainfall could completely replace the existing water needs. The average energy use was 19,526 kWh for propane and electricity per year at a cost of $2055 US dollars. The largest uses of electricity were in-tank water heaters. Comparing inputs to outputs, 104 L of water, 0.5 kg feed, and 56 kWh energy ($6 in energy costs) were needed to produce 1 kg of crops; and 292 L of water, 1.3 kg feed, and 159 kWh of energy ($12 in energy costs) were needed to produce a 1 kg increase in tilapia. Raising tilapia was a net loss, while raising crops was a net gain when comparing market prices to energy costs. Understanding energy, water, and feed use in aquaponic systems is essential to inform farm business plans. These data can serve as a point of comparison to other small-scale aquaponic systems, and inform future work on life cycle assessments of aquaponics. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics. There is expanding interest in aquaponics as a form of aquaculture that can be used to produce food closer to urban centers. Commercial aquaponics uses methods and equipment from both the hydroponics and aquaculture industries. There have been few studies of commercial-scale aquaponics production, and the purpose of this research was to document the production methods, crop and fish yields, and profitability of commercial aquaponics in the United States (US) and internationally. An online survey was used for data collection, and 257 respondents met the inclusion criteria for the study. Eighty-one percent of respondents lived in the US, and the remaining respondents were from 22 other countries. The median year that respondents had begun practicing aquaponics was 2010. A total of 538 full-time workers, 242 part-time workers, and 1720 unpaid workers or volunteers were employed at surveyed organizations. The most commonly raised aquatic animals by percent were tilapia (69%), ornamental fish (43%), catfish (25%), other aquatic animals (18%), perch (16%), bluegill (15%), trout (10%), and bass (7%). Production statistics, gross sales revenue, investments, and sales outlets for operations are reported and compared to other fields of aquaculture and agriculture. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to study which factors were associated with profitability (as a binary outcome) in the past 12 months. Several factors were significantly associated with profitability: aquaponics as the respondents' primary source of income (p < 0.01; Odds Ratio: 5.79; 95% Confidence Interval: 3.8-9.0), location in US Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 7-13 (p < 0.01; OR: 4.17; 95% CI: 3.2-5.5), gross sales revenue >=$5000 (p < 0.01; OR: 3.58; 95% CI: 2.2-5.8), greater aquaponics knowledge (p < 0.01; OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 2.0-2.9), and sales of non-food products (e. g., supplies, materials, consulting services, workshops, and agrotourism) (p = 0.028; OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.1-4.2). Our survey findings provide a better understanding of the business of aquaponics, which may enhance future commercial operations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Aquaponics, a combination of fish farming and soilless plant farming, is growing in popularity and gaining attention as an important and potentially more sustainable method of food production. The aim of this study was to document and analyze the production methods, experiences, motivations, and demographics of aquaponics practitioners in the United States (US) and internationally. The survey was distributed online using a chain sampling method that relied on referrals from initial respondents, with 809 respondents meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority of respondents were from the US (80%), male (78%), and had at least a high school degree (91%). The mean age of respondents was 47613 years old. Most respondents (52%) had three years or less of aquaponics experience. Respondents typically raised tilapia or ornamental fish and a variety of leafy green vegetables, herbs, and fruiting crops. Respondents were most often motivated to become involved in aquaponics to grow their own food, for environmental sustainability reasons, and for personal health reasons. Many respondents employed more than one method to raise crops, and used alternative or environmentally sustainable sources of energy, water, and fish feed. In general, our findings suggest that aquaponics is a dynamic and rapidly growing field with participants who are actively experimenting with and adopting new technologies. Additional research and outreach is needed to evaluate and communicate best practices within the field. This survey is the first large-scale effort to track aquaponics in the US and provides information that can better inform policy, research, and education efforts regarding aquaponics as it matures and possibly evolves into a mainstream form of agriculture.

AB The continuous use of agrochemical inputs in modern agriculture for better crop productivity has resulted in unexpected environmental impact. This issue has raised public interest in exploring environmental friendly sustainable practices. In this study, three strains of Azospirillum brasilense (Sp7, Sp7-S and Sp245) were evaluated for their impacts on the growth of lettuce seedlings grown with fish effluent (FE) as a source of nutrients. Lettuce seeds were inoculated with these strains before sowing and at transplanting, and grown under greenhouse condition with natural light. Despite the existing indigenous microflora and low level of nutrients in the FE, the A. brasilense strains survived at populations ranging from 5 to 6cfug(-1) of roots and altered important agronomic traits, which led to growth enhancement. In particular, inoculated seedlings showed significant increase in the number of leaves, seedling height and root length. Chlorophyll and protein content were also improved, but only with Sp7 strain. However, the expression of pathogenesis-related protein, i.e., peroxidase, and level of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid increased by more than 50% in response to inoculation with the strains. Azospirillum inoculation also showed little or no adverse impact on the FE bacterial community indicating that it can be incorporated into a system that uses FE as a nutrient source, e.g., aquaponics. Thus, A. brasilense could be a valuable agent to help maximize the usefulness of FE or wastewater from freshwater aquaculture to further support plant growth.

AB The main objective of this study was to test an innovative biomitigation approach, where polychaete-assisted (Hediste diversicolor) sand filters were combined with the production of Halimione portulacoides in aquaponics, to remediate an organic-rich effluent generated by a super intensive fish farm operating a land-based RAS (Recirculating aquaculture system). The set up included four different experimental combinations that were periodically monitored for 5 months. After this period, polychaete-assisted sand filters reduced in 70% the percentage of OM and the average densities increased from approximate to 400 ind.m(-2) to 7000 ind.m(-2). H. portulacoides in aquaponics contributed to an average DIN (Dissolved inorganic Nitrogen) decrease of 65%, which increased to 67% when preceded by filter tanks stocked with polychaetes. From May until October (5 months) halophytes biomass increased from 1.4 kg m(-2) +/- 0.7 (initial wet weight) to 18.6 kg m(-2) +/- 4.0. Bearing in mind that the uptake of carbon is mostly via photosynthesis and not though the uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon, this represents an approximate incorporation of approximate to 1.3 kg m(-2) carbon (C), approximate to 15 g m(-2) nitrogen (N) and approximate to 8 g m(-2) phosphorus (P) in the aerial part (76% of total biomass), and an approximate incorporation of approximate to 0.5 kg m(-2) carbon (C), approximate to 3 g m(-2) nitrogen (N) and approximate to 2 g m(-2) phosphorus (P) in the roots (24% of total biomass). In the present study, the potential of the two extractive species for biomitigation of a super-intensive marine fish farm effluent could be clearly demonstrated, contributing in this way to potentiate the implementation of more sustainable practices.

AB Acute toxicity of copper, lead and iron to tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus fry and fingerlings was tested using 24 h to 96 h static non-renewal toxicity tests. Three methods, probit analysis, Spearman-Karber and a linear regression model, were used to calculate LC50 concentrations. For all three heavy metals, the LC50 concentrations were higher for fingerlings than for fry. Copper was more toxic than lead and iron to both life stages. The species sensitivity distributions of O. mossambicus, as well as those of freshwater fish species from the ECOTOX database and literature, were closely predicted by the models for all three metals. The sensitivity of O. mossambicus to copper, iron and lead varied significantly. The early life stages of Oreochromis mossambicus were less sensitive to copper and lead than most freshwater fish species. The HC5 concentrations that can be used as guidelines to protect 95% of freshwater fish species in similar environments to O. mossambicus were determined as being <0.001, <0.17 and <0.96 mg l(-1) for copper, lead and iron, respectively. Although there are limited data on heavy metals, the toxicity data generated in this study can be applied in risk assessments for local freshwater species in the rivers of Limpopo province.

AB Aquaponics (AP), the integrated multi-trophic fish and plants production in quasi-closed recirculating system, is one of the newest sustainable food production systems. The hydroponic component of the AP directly influences water quality (in turn influencing fish growth and health), and water consumption (through evapotranspiration) of the entire system. In order to assess the role of the design and the management of the hydroponic component on the overall performance, and water consumption of the aquaponics, 122 papers published from 1979 to 2017 were reviewed. Although no unequivocal results were found, the nutrient film technique appears in several aspects less efficient than medium-based or floating raft hydroponics. The best system performance in terms of fish and plant growth, and the highest nutrient removal from water was achieved at water flow between 0.8 L min(-1) and 8.0 L min(-1). Data on water consumption of aquaponics are scarce, and no correlation between the ratio of hydroponic unit surface/fish tank volume and the system water loss was found. However, daily water loss was positively correlated with the hydroponic surface/fish tank volume ratio if the same experimental conditions and/or systems were compared. The plant species grown in hydroponics influenced the daily water loss in aquaponics, whereas no effect was exerted by the water flow (reciprocating flood/drain cycle or constant flow) or type (medium-based, floating or nutrient film technique) of hydroponics.

ID TOMATOES; YIELD
AB Fish and vegetable production were linked in a recirculating water system designed to achieve a high degree of efficiency of water use for food production in addition to functional and technological simplicity. Hybrid tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus x O. niloticus L. were grown in tanks associated with biofilters (sand beds) in which tomatoes Lycopersicon esculentum were grown. The effect of four biofilter volume (BFV)/fish rearing tank volume ratios (0.67/1, 1.00/1, 1.50/1, 2.25/1) on water use efficiency was evaluated. 'Laura' (first experiment) or 'Kewalo' tomatoes were grown 4/m(2) in biofilters of four different sizes and surface-irrigated 8 times daily with water from the associated fish tanks. Daily water consumption increased with BFV/tank ratios and with time. Fish production rates increased with biofilter volume in the first experiment, but were not significantly different in the second experiment. Total tomato fruit yield per plot increased from 13.7 to 31.7 kg (Experiment 1) and from 19.9 to 33.1 kg (Experiment 2) with increasing BFV/tank ratio. For fish plus fruit, total energy production increased from 4,950 to 8,963 kcal/plot and from 4,804 to 7,424 kcal/plot in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, and protein production increased from 536 to 794 and from 352 to 483 g/plot in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, with increasing BFV/tank ratio. Trends in water use efficiency for production of food energy (kcal/L) and of protein (gn) in tomatoes and fish were complex. Water use efficiency for total energy production (fish plus fruit) did not significantly differ with biofilter volume. Economy of water use for total protein production (fish plus fruit) decreased significantly with increasing BFV/tank ratio. The component ratios of the system may be manipulated to favor fish or vegetable production according to local market trends or dietary needs, and thus may have economic potential in areas of limited water supply and high demand for quality food.

AB The first commercial aquaponics companies are starting up in Europe. The main focus has been on solving technology issues and optimizing production. However, increasing attention is now being paid to certification and regulations linked to aquaponics, as well as the marketing of products and services. The paper presents the results of a study whose main aim was to estimate consumers' knowledge about aquaponics and their acceptance of aquaponics products in different European regions. An on-line questionnaire was administered to the general public through the aquaponics network of Food and Agriculture COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action FA1305 The EU Aquaponics HubRealising Sustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU in 16 European countries. The methodology includes univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. The results show that, on average, attitudes towards aquaponics were positive, showing no significant differences between those who already knew about aquaponics and those who only heard about it through the survey. More than 50% of respondents had never heard of aquaponics, whilst more than 70% had already heard of hydroponics. No more than 17% of respondents were willing to pay more for aquaponically produced products and no more than 40% more when compared to the price of products from conventional farming. The results confirm three different clusters of potential consumers of aquaponics products. They also suggest an urgent need for implementing integrated and holistic approaches involving all stakeholders in aquaponics, in order to define a marketing plan and efficient communication strategies. This COST action, other projects and public decision makers must invest in educating consumers about aquaponics through the organization of guided tours, thematic workshops and tastings of aquaponics products in order to raise their awareness about this new technology. It is absolutely urgent that public decision makers, in cooperation with aquaponics stakeholders, address the main institutional constraints, namely the introduction of aquaponics as an economic activity and the organic certification of aquaponics products.

TI Analysis of aquaponic organic hydroponics from the perspective of
   setting costs and of maintenance on substratum and floating shelves
   systems.
SO Journal of Horticulture, Forestry and Biotechnology
LA English
DT Journal article
AB Old forms of aquaponic organic hydroponics can be traced in many ancient peoples, such as the Chinampa Aztec culture, the cultures around Lakes Inle in Myanmar, the Waru Waru culture of the tribe Uru on the shores of Lake Titicaca in Peru, and rice paddies in China. Scientifically, the first studies regarding soilless cultures were carried on by Francis Bacon who published "Sylva Sylvarum" in 1627. Intrigued by his discoveries, Justus von Liebing elaborated the mineral theory of plant nutrition in 1842, John Woodward added soil particles to water in 1699, De Saussure noted in 1804 that pants are made of compounds that are also found in water and air, and Justus von Liebing published in 1842 a list of elements essential for plant growth. Starting with 1842, research in hydroponics continued until 1980 when Mark McMurtry managed to achieve the first aquaponic organic hydroponics system; in 2004, they acknowledged the superiority of this type of culture. At present, aquaponic organic hydroponics meets the most diverse requirements; it can be met in deserted areas, in areas with severe ecological accidents and in intensive or small-size cultures. In this study, the authors analyse substratum culture and floating shelves culture for small areas to show the advantages of each system from the perspective of setting costs and of system maintenance. Thus, we can see that the floating shelves system is neatly superior since it requires small funds for setting and maintenance; the substratum system is better only from the perspective of plant distance and plant size because substratum provides plants with increased stability.

AB In classical aquaponics (coupled aquaponic systems, 1-loop systems) the production of fish in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) and plants in hydroponics are combined in a single loop, entailing systemic compromises on the optimal production parameters (e.g. pH). Recently presented decoupled aquaponics (2-loop systems) have been awarded for eliminating major bottlenecks. In a pilot study, production in an innovative decoupled aquaponic system was compared with a coupled system and, as a control, a conventional RAS, assessing growth parameters of fish (FCR, SGR) and plants over an experimental period of 5 months. Soluble nutrients (NO3--N, NO2--N, NH4+-N, PO43-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl2- and Fe2+), elemental composition of plants, fish and sludge (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, C), abiotic factors (temperature, pH, oxygen, and conductivity), fertilizer and water consumption were determined. Fruit yield was 36% higher in decoupled aquaponics and pH and fertilizer management was more effective, whereas fish production was comparable in both systems. The results of this pilot study clearly illustrate the main advantages of decoupled, two-loop aquaponics and demonstrate how bottlenecks commonly encountered in coupled aquaponics can be managed to promote application in aquaculture.

AB In recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), mechanical removal of suspended solids by clarifiers or drum filters provides an organic mixture rich in nutrients. Still, in most traditional RAS, this sludge is discharged directly or following dewatering. Here, the potential recycling of nutrients from sludge is assessed, comparing aerobic and anaerobic mobilization of nutrients experimentally, ultimately aiming at an application in aquaponic systems. Nutrient mobilization processes were studied, monitoring soluble nutrients photometrically in the treatment tanks (NO3--N, NO2--N, total ammonia nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP], K+, Mg2+ and Fe2+), the nutrient composition of the sludge (total phosphorus, Fe, Mn, Al, S, Mg, Ca) by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, as well as C: N ratio, total solids (TS) and total suspended solids (TSS). Aerobic treatment (aerated, AT) resulted in a 3.2-fold increase in mean (+/- SD) SRP from 9.4 (+/- 0.7) to 29.7 (+/- 2.1) mg l(-1), most likely owing to a decrease in pH. In contrast, in the anaerobic treatment (unaerated, UT), SRP remained unchanged between 9.4 (+/- 0.7) and 9.3 (+/- 0.4) mg l(-1). Both treatments resulted in increased K+ concentrations from 28.1 (+/- 1.5) to 36.8 (+/- 2.3) mg l(-1) in AT and to 32.2 (+/- 2.3) mg l(-1) in UT. AT revealed best mobilization of P and K+ without major losses of NO3--N. Thus, aerobic treatment of water-sludge mixture has a high potential for significant improvements of nutrient recycling in aquaponics.

AB This investigation is aimed to improve the knowledge on the physiological alterations occurring at morphological and molecular level in European sea bass naturally infected by A. ocellatum and reared at different salinities.
   European sea bass juveniles (Dicentrarchus labrax) weighing 20 +/- 0.5 g were divided in three aquaponics systems: CTRL, reared at 20 ppt salinity; AFI, reared in freshwater (0 ppt) and infected with the dinoflagellate Amyloodinium ocellatum; ASI, reared at 20 ppt salinity and infected with A. ocellatum. Beta vulgaris plants were introduced in each of the aquaponic systems. Temperature was increased 1 degrees C every second day from 18 to 25 degrees C during the experiment.
   At the end of the trial, liver, brain, intestine and gills were sampled for molecular and histological analyses. A. ocellatum affected D. labrax growth (insulin-like growth factor I, IGF-I) and appetite (Neuropeptide Y, NPY) signals in ASI. Immune system was activated in ASI by the presence of parasites by producing higher levels of Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), codifying for a protein involved in lipid metabolism, was upregulated in ASI because of the necessity to produce energy to maintain homeostasis. On the contrary, A. ocellatum did not cause signs of infection in AFI as confirmed by gene expression and histological analysis, that were similar to CTRL. However, in freshwater reared fish, a modification of lipid metabolism was observed through a reduction in PPAR alpha gene expression and hepatic lipid content. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Phosphorus is a unique element. It is the limiting nutrient controlling biological productivity in many terrestrial and marine environments. When in excess, however, dissolved phosphate leads to uncontrollable biological growth and water-quality problems through a process called eutrophication. The use of phosphate minerals and their products as fertilizers has increased tremendously global food production; it would not be possible to feed the current world population without phosphate fertilizers. Yet phosphate is a limited global resource; current estimates suggest economic phosphorus supply may be severely depleted over the next 100 years. Nevertheless, mineralogists and geochemists have invested little time investigating phosphate mineral stability, reactivity, and transformations. This issue attempts to bring phosphates to the forefront of our scientific endeavours.

DT Journal article
AB Two identical closed ebb-flow substrate aquaponic systems for warm-water fish were tested for their chemo-physical characteristics under the production of fish and plants in a freshwater environment with an experimental increasing feed input. Each system contained 3.7 m3 water, and the relationship of the water volume in the aquaculture tank to the settling basin (sedimenter), the biofilter and the hydroponic units was 2.25:1:0.075:0.6 (fish tank:hydroponic unit=3.75), with a daily water input of 5.77% (0.20) and a water removal rate of 1.37% (0.04) per day. The experiment was divided into three sub-experiments (49 days SE I, 56 days SE II, 55 days SE III), characterized by increasing mean (24.85 g (0.36)) and total (1,217.50 g (17.68)) feed input levels in SE I, 131.12 g (4.99) and 7,342.50 g (279.31) in SE II, and 221.72 g (8.78) and 11,751.00 g (465.28) in SE III, respectively. Sub-experiment I was the run-in phase, characterized by low nutrient loads, fish and plant weights. This phase showed increasing values of oxygen, phosphate, salinity and conductivity. SE II was the exponential phase, with increasing feed input, fish and plant weights, until a distinct drop in oxygen levels occurred, and increasing conductivity, salinity and nutrient loads. SE III was the steady phase, where the feed input of 200 g day-1 balanced the oxygen level, salinity, conductivity and nutrient load, with a water input of 6.53% (0.02) and a lower removal rate of 1.23% (0.00) per day. Nile tilapia fry (Oreochromis niloticus) of 0.50 g initial weight resulted in an individual fish weight gain of 60.93 g (28.95), a specific growth ratio (SGR) of 3.04% d-1 (0.34), 24.25 kg of biomass weight gain and a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 0.83 in system I, and a non-significant weight gain (p<0.05) of 51.29 g (16.20), an SGR of 2.98% d-1 (0.21), 20.42 kg of biomass weight gain and an FCR of 0.93 in system II. The overall yield of tomato biomass was 20.03 kg. In this communication, we describe our experimental ebb-flow aquaponic system to demonstrate the influence of system design on the chemophysical parameters, system stability, and fish and plant growth. The importance of other, as yet untested, parameters that may influence economic sustainability, e.g. feed design, fish welfare, parasite and pathogen control, fish physiology, fish/plant combinations and product quality, are discussed.

AB Aquaponics is rapidly developing as the need for sustainable food production increases and freshwater and phosphorous reserves shrink. Starting from small-scale operations, aquaponics is at the brink of commercialization, attracting investment. Arising from integrated freshwater aquaculture, a variety of methods and system designs has developed that focus either on fish or plant production. Public interest in aquaponics has increased dramatically in recent years, in line with the trend towards more integrated value chains, greater productivity and less harmful environmental impact compared to other production systems. New business models are opening up, with new customers and markets, and with this expansion comes the potential for confusion, misunderstanding and deception. New stakeholders require guidelines and detail concerning the different system designs and their potentials. We provide a definitive definition of aquaponics, where the majority (> 50%) of nutrients sustaining the optimal plant growth derives from waste originating from feeding aquatic organisms, classify the available integrated aquaculture and aquaponics (open, domestic, demonstration, commercial) systems and designs, distinguish four different scales of production (<= 50, > 50-<= 100 m(2), > 100-<= 500 m(2), > 500 m(2)) and present a definite nomenclature for aquaponics and aquaponic farming allowing distinctions between the technologies that are in use. This enables authorities, customers, producers and all other stakeholders to distinguish between the various systems, to better understand their potentials and constraints and to set priorities for business and regulations in order to transition RAS or already integrated aquaculture into commercial aquaponic systems.

AB Aquaponics is an integrated production system where plants grow in a soil-less medium of aquaculture waste. This kind of production is seen as favourable nowadays since waste utilization could increase farm productivity and reduce environmental impacts. This research compared the microbiological quality of aquaponic water under ultraviolet (UV) sterilization and its compliance to international directives on irrigation water uses. An assessment of crop productivity was also carried out to outline differences in productive traits of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. 'Verde degli Ortolani') grown in sterilized and non-sterilized aquaponic systems against a hydroponics floating system supplied with a nutrient solution of 1.6 dS cm(-1). Total coliforms under UV disinfection showed counts well below 1 CFU ml(-1) and a reduction in microbial loads higher than 99%. Furthermore no Escherichia coli were found in both sterilized and non-sterilized aquaponic systems. No significant differences were recorded for productive traits of lettuce (yield, mean shoot weight, shoot and root dry biomass, leaf area, specific leaf dry weight), suggesting that aquaponics is a valid method to produce vegetables with high hygienic standards.

AB Aquaponics is a vegetable production system that integrates soilless cultivation and aquaculture. Plants strip nutrients from fish waste water and convert metabolites toxic to fish. Aquaponics is an environmental-friendly production system due to its full reuse of waste and nutrients. The research, carried out at the Experimental Farm of the University of Tuscia, compared summer yields of two romaine lettuce crops (Lactuca sativa L. 'Integral') grown on aquaponic and hydroponic floating systems. For the hydroponic treatment a nutritive solution of 1.7 dS m(-1) and pH 5.5 supported plant growth. For the aquaponic system two treatments under different fish densities supplied nutrients at different concentrations. Every aquaponic treatment consisted of 3 independent 250-L tanks stocked with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.). Each fish tank fed a 1.5 m(2) floating system under a 20 plant m(-2) density. For the first crop 110 g and 24 g tilapia were stocked at system setup respectively under a low (5 kg m(-3)) and high (8 kg m(-3)) density and supplied nutrients with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.4 and 0.6 dS m(-1). For the second crop 168 g and 90 g tilapia respectively stocked under a low (6 kg m(-3)) and high (20 kg m(-3)) stocking density raised EC levels to 0.5 and 1.0 dS m(-1). Production of 2.8 kg m(-2) from the first hydroponic crop was similar to the 2.7 kg m(-2) assessed in the high density aquaponic treatment. Conversely the 2.3 kg m(-2) measured in the low density treatment was smaller. For the second trial no differences were noticed between the 6.0 kg m(-2) measured in the hydroponic system and the 5.7 and 5.6 kg m(-2) assessed in the high and low-density aquaponic treatments, respectively. Nevertheless different nutrient concentrations in water affected plant mineral composition. Aquaponic leaves were poorer in phosphorus but richer in calcium, potassium magnesium and sodium.

AB Iron is one of the essential elements for a proper plant development. Providing plants with an accessible form of iron is crucial when it is scant or unavailable in soils. Chemical chelates are the only current alternative and are highly stable in soils, therefore, posing a threat to drinking water. The aim of this investigation was to quantify siderophores produced by two bacterial strains and to determine if these bacterial siderophores would palliate chlorotic symptoms of iron-starved tomato plants. For this purpose, siderophore production in MM9 medium by two selected bacterial strains was quantified, and the best was used for biological assay. Bacterial culture media free of bacteria (S) and with bacterial cells (BS), both supplemented with Fe were delivered to 12-week-old plants grown under iron starvation in hydroponic conditions; controls with full Hoagland solution, iron-free Hoagland solution and water were also conducted. Treatments were applied twice along the experiment, with a week in between. At harvest, plant yield, chlorophyll content and nutritional status in leaves were measured. Both the bacterial siderophore treatments significantly increased plant yield, chlorophyll and iron content over the positive controls with full Hoagland solution, indicating that siderophores are effective in providing Fe to the plant, either with or without the presence of bacteria. In summary, siderophores from strain Chryseobacterium C138 are effective in supplying Fe to iron-starved tomato plants by the roots, either with or without the presence of bacteria. Based on the amount of siderophores produced, an effective and economically feasible organic Fe chelator could be developed.

DE hydroponic; aquaponics; aquaculture; recirculating system; nutrient
AB Aquaponics is the combined culture of fish and hydroponic plants in recirculating systems. Aquaculture effluent provides most of the nutrients required by plants if the optimum ratio between daily feed input and plant growing area is maintained. An experiment was conducted in an outdoor, commercial-scale aquaponic system on 0.05 ha of land in the tropics. The objectives were to determine the production of tilapia and basil using batch and staggered cropping systems, compare aquaponics with field crop production and evaluate the ratio of feed input to plant growing area. The projected annual production of tilapia was 4.37 t. The mean yield of basil was 2.0, 1.8 and 0.6 kg/m(2) using batch, staggered and field cropping systems, respectively. Projected annual production of the system was 5.0 t of basil with staggered production. Nutrient deficiency symptoms appeared only in the batch-cultured basil. The feed input ratio was 81.4 g/day/m(2) for batch culture and 99.6 g/day/m(2) for staggered production. Staggered production moderated the uptake of nutrients. Basil production is sustainable in an aquaponic system with a feed input ratio of 99.6 g/day/m(2) and a staggered cropping system.

AB Aquaponics is the combined culture of fish and plants in recirculating systems. This experiment was conducted to evaluate the production of basil out of the aquaponic system by irrigation of the plants with different ratios of hydroponic and aquaponic solutions. Basil seedlings were irrigated three times day(-1) with 200 mL aquaponic-aquaponic-aquaponic (AAA), aquaponic-hydroponic-aquaponic (AHA), hydroponic-aquaponic-hydroponic (HAH), and hydroponic-hydroponic-hydroponic (HHH) solutions, respectively. Fresh and dry mass of shoots and roots of basil decreased at AAA treatment significantly. The plants were slightly less green at AHA treatments, and a visible chlorosis appeared in the leaves of AAA-treated plants. This chlorosis resulted lower net carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance in AAA treatment. Iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and potassium (K) concentrations in leaves decreased and zinc (Zn) concentration increased in higher ratios of aquaponic: hydroponic solution. Lower Fe, Mn, and K concentrations in aquaponic solution may be a main part of the reason for growth reduction.

AB An experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of foliar applications of different Fe sources on pepper plants grown in alkaline aquaponic solutions. Common carp was stocked in the rearing tanks at 50 fish m(-3). The fish were fed three times daily with a pellet diet containing 46% protein. Twenty days old pepper seedlings were transplanted on to growth bed units of aquaponic system after stocking of carp fish for 2 months in the rearing tanks. Foliar nutrients application began 30 days after transplantation. Four treatments were used, untreated control, foliar application at the rate of 200 mL plant(-1) with 0.5 g Fe L-1 FeSO4, Fe-EDTA, and Fe-EDDHA. Plants were sprayed twice a month. The results showed that overall growth was significantly increased by foliar Fe application, and the highest values of vegetative and reproductive growth parameters were recorded in plants treated with FeSO4. The lowest chlorophyll content was observed in untreated plants. The highest SPAD index, maximal quantum yield of PS II photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and performance index (PI) values of young and old leaves were found with FeSO4, with no difference between Fe-EDTA and Fe-EDDHA treatments. The Fe treatment led to a significant increase of shoot Fe concentration in pepper plants, so that the highest shoot Fe concentration was observed in plants sprayed with Fe-sulfate, whereas Fe-EDTA and Fe-EDDHA led to intermediate concentrations and control led to the lowest one. Foliar fertilization of pepper plants with different Fe sources had a beneficial effect on the essential nutrient uptake and transport in plants. Thus, present results revealed that application of foliar Fe must be performed in the aquaponic system, to overcome Fe deficiencies in alkaline conditions and to make better nutritional status.

AB A detailed kinetic model has been developed to describe the oxidation of Fe(II) in seawater in both the absence and the presence of natural organic material. Experimental data were collected using a luminol chemiluminescence-based method to measure Fe(II), assuming that both the inorganic and the organically complexed species were detected. In the absence of organic matter, the data were modeled based on the Haber-Weiss mechanism with the inclusion of a back-reaction of Fe(III) with superoxide and precipitation of Fe(OH)(3). Both reactions were found to be significant using sensitivity analysis. When organic matter is present, the model was extended by organic complexation of Fe(II) and Fe(III) with the creation of a parallel oxidation pathway for Fe(II). Fe(II) oxidation at natural (nanomolar) concentrations was accurately predicted for a range of organic concentrations. The model also accounted for scavenging of superoxide by sub-nanomolar levels of dissolved copper and by organic matter when present. The presence of a relatively strong Fe(III) binding ligand was observed to significantly increase the rate of Fe(II) oxidation, while ultimately retaining most of the iron in the system in dissolved (organically complexed) form. The complexation reactions and reaction of inorganic and organically bound Fe(II) with oxygen were found to be critical reactions in the system, while Fe(III) hydrolysis became unimportant even at low organic concentrations. The superoxide radical was also observed to have a major role in the cycling of iron due to its ability to act as both an oxidant and a reductant. The model indicates that the rate constant for the reaction of Fe(II) with O-2 has generally been underestimated in previous work and that the secondary oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2 and subsequently OH. plays a relatively minor role in these systems.

AB Aquaponics is one of the "zero waste" industry in the twenty-first century, and is considered to be one of the major trends for the future development of agriculture. However, the low nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) restricted its widely application. To date, many attempts have been conducted to improve its NUE. In the present study, effect of micro- and macro-nutrient addition on performance of tilapia-pak choi aquaponics was investigated. Results showed that the addition of micro- and macro-nutrients improved the growth of plant directly and facilitated fish physiology indirectly, which subsequently increased NUE of aquaponics from 40.42 to 50.64%. In addition, remarkable lower total phosphorus concentration was obtained in aquaponics with micro- and macro-nutrient addition, which was attributed to the formation of struvite. Most of the added micro-nutrients were enriched in plant root, while macro-nutrients mainly existed in water. Moreover, no enrichment of micro- and macro-nutrients in aquaponic products (i.e., fish and plant leaves) was observed, indicating that it had no influence on food safety. The findings here reported manifest that appropriate addition of micro- and macro-nutrients to aquaponics is necessary, and would improve its economic feasibility.

TI ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF INTEGRATING A HYDROPONIC-LETTUCE SYSTEM INTO A
   BARRAMUNDI FISH PRODUCTION SYSTEM
SO Aquaculture Economics and Management
LA English
DT Article
AB The economic benefits of an aquaculture-hydroponic integrated system are evaluated using a hydroponic-lettuce and barramundi fish production system as a case study. Technical data were obtained for a case study farm located at Port Stephens, New South Wales, Australia. The net present values of annual cash flows over a 10-year planning horizon were determined for barramundi and lettuce production as stand-alone units, and alternatively as integrated units, using a capital budgeting framework. Integrated production enables barramundi effluent to be used as a source of nutrients for the lettuce production. This results in an increase in net benefits equal to the reduction in barramundi effluent disposal costs, and the saving of some water and nutrient costs of the lettuce system.

AB Recirculation aquaculture systems (RASs) are increasingly considered as production systems of the future with a minimum ecological impact for the production of aquatic food. To maintain a good water quality and to produce quality and healthy fishery products, the systems depend on a diverse microbial community involved in different processes of water purification but also in unwanted effects. The article reviews the present knowledge on microorganisms in RAS, their relative distribution within the system compartments and their role in system performance. The system possesses different microniches in which microorganisms retrieve their preferential conditions for oxygen and nutrients. Ammonia and nitrite are oxidized under aerobic conditions into less toxic compounds. Anaerobic ammonium oxidizers in the biofilm oxidize anaerobically both ammonia and nitrites into less harmful dinitrogen gas. Heterotrophic bacteria mineralize organic matter derived from uneaten feeds, dead bodies and excreta of fish. Under conditions of high organic load and high C/N content, nitrifiers are overgrown by heterotrophs with negative effects to the nitrification process. For not yet understood reasons, the presence of off-flavour-producing microorganisms occurs also in RAS. Microbial management and management of inputs to the systems to prevent the proliferation of pathogens are discussed and possible management techniques of off-flavours are also presented. Research orientations are given to explore further the potential of heterotrophic bacteria in microbial management and intensive aquaculture production in systems other than RAS.

AB An aquaponic system was built, based on the University of Virgin Islands design, as a prototype for commercialization in Alberta, Canada in 2002. It consists of four fish rearing tanks (5 m(-3) each) and four raft hydroponic troughs (29 m(-2) each). To test commercial feasibility of aquaponics under the climatic conditions of Alberta the food fish tilapia was selected in combination with several conventional greenhouse plants (cucumber, tomato, etc.), herbs, medicinal plants, and nutraceutical plants. A protocol was developed for producing aquaponic crops in Alberta. More than 60 different crops and varieties were tested in a greenhouse. Based on this preliminary evaluation, 24 crops (five greenhouse vegetables and 19 herbs) were grown in trials to determine production levels. Yields of tomatoes and mini-cucumbers reached 20.7 kg plant(-1) year(-1) and 33.4 kg plant(-1) year(-1) and exceeded average values of commercial greenhouses in Alberta that employ conventional hydroponic technology. During the 2-year study, the yield of Genovese basil increased from 13 kg m(-2) year(-1) to 42 kg m(-2) year(-1) as production and harvesting methods were refined. This study demonstrated the technical feasibility of the aquaponic technology in Alberta. Evaluation of the economic feasibility is under way.

AB Aquaponics is a solution for sustainable production of fish and plants in a single semi-closed system, where nutrient-rich water from the aquaculture provides nutrients for plant growth. We examined the microbial communities within an experimental aquaponics system. Whereas the fish feces contained a separate community dominated by bacteria of the genus Cetobacterium, the samples from plant roots, biofilter, and periphyton were more similar to each other, while the communities were more diverse. Detailed examination of the data gave the first indications to functional groups of organisms in the different compartments of the aquaponic system. As other nitrifiers other than members of the genus Nitrospira were only present at low numbers, it was anticipated that Nitrospirae may perform the nitrification process in the biofilm.

ID WASTE-WATER
AB Aquaponics (AP) is a food production system that combines hydroponic (HP) crop production with recirculating aquaculture. Different types of hydroponic systems have been used for growing crops in aquaponics. However, very few studies have compared their suitability and efficiency in an aquaponic context. The study presented here compares tomato yield, morphological (external) and biochemical (internal) fruit quality, and overall tomato plant vitality from three different HP systems (nutrient film technique, drip irrigation system, and floating raft culture) and examines the distribution of nutrients in different parts of the tomato plant. Three replicate AP systems were set up, each incorporating the three different HP systems coupled with a separate recirculating aquaculture unit growing Nile tilapia. The results showed that the choice of the cultivation system had little influence on most of the above-mentioned properties. Tomato fruit mineral content was found to be in similar range for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Zn as reported in the literature. Yield and fruit quality were similar in all three systems. However, the drip irrigation system did perform slightly better. The slightly higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of the fruits grown in AP in comparison to commercially produced and supermarket derived tomatoes might indicate a potential for producing fruits with higher health value for humans.

AB Changes in concentrations of dissolved Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, NO(3)-N; Na, P, and Zn, as a function of increasing biomass of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fed a commercial diet in integrated aquaculture-hydroponic systems growing romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa longifolia cv. Jericho), were monitored over three, 28-day experimental trials. The integrated systems, 320-330 1 in volume, were filled initially with a complete nutrient hydroponic solution, and were operated at a 100% recirculation rate. Treatment levels were 0 (control) 151, 377, 902, and 1804 g of fish/system and treatments were conducted in duplicate, Nutrient concentrations and mutual ratios of nutrients quickly departed from initial conditions because the relative proportion of dissolved nutrients excreted by fish and subsequently absorbed by plants differed. The removal of nutrients by lettuce, fish, and solids collection was determined as a function of treatment size. The objective of this study was to quantify both the flow of nutrients through representative integrated aquaculture-hydroponics systems and the effects of different quantities of feed nutrient input on changes in nutrient-specific concentrations.

AB An experiment was conducted at the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, for 54 clays to investigate on the effect of pond water filtration and aggregates (hydroponic substrates) on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L) production, nutrient uptake and growth. A 2 x 3 factorial experiment consisting of 2 filtration regimes (unfiltered versus partially filtered pond water) and 3 aggregates (styrofoam as control, sand, and gravel). The hydroponic units were placed on a bamboo platform across the pond surface. An earthen pond (226 m(2)) was stocked with 8000 hybrid catfish with an average initial weight of 6.58 +/- 1.72 g. The fish were fed with commercial pelleted feeds containing 30% crude protein. Twenty-one days old lettuce seedlings were transplanted on to hydroponic units after stocking catfish for 4 months in the pond. Pond water was partially filtered by using a settling tank and filtration tank, which contained netting materials to trap solids. Lettuce plots were irrigated twice daily at 0800 and 1600 h using either filtered or unfiltered pond water for 45 min.
   The highest head weight and yield of lettuce were observed with plants grown on the sand media followed by gravel and the control treatments. Partially filtered pond water treatments had significantly higher lettuce yield (P < 0.05) and filtration increased lettuce yield of the control, gravel and sand treatments by 87, 63 and 52%, respectively, over unfiltered water treatments. Lettuce grown on gravel and the filtered water control treatments had adequate tissue N content. Nutrient rich hybrid catfish (Clarias macrocephalus x Clarias gariepinus) pond water provides an opportunity to use it in the hydroponic vegetable production.
   Although pond water is mainly constrained by the high suspended solids, and low dissolved oxygen, the study showed that filtration of catfish pond water enhanced the potential to use it for the hydroponic lettuce production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aquaponics is an integrated system in which the water containing fish waste is used as a nutrient source for plant production in a closed recirculation system. In this study, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and pak choi (Brassica chinensis) culture was tested using two techniques: 1) Root floating (RAFT), and 2) Dynamic root floating (DRFT). Water quality parameters, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and phosphate were measured. At the end of the experiment, fish and plants were weighed and the required electric power consumption was calculated. There was no significant difference observed between the effect of each treatment group on either tilapia or pak choi production. Tilapia productivity was 1.69 +/- 022 kg/m3 and 1.71 +/- 0.23 kg/m3 and pak choi yield was 7.43 +/- 1.23Icg/m2 and 7.32 +/- 0.76 kg/m2 for the RAFT and DRFT, respectively. Water quality parameters were within the recommended range for the tilapia culture while pH and conductivity were out of range for the pak choi culture; nevertheless, plant production was good. Total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen did not reach concentrations that could impede tilapia growth. The DRFT allows the elimination of active aeration in hydroponic systems for tilapia and pak choi production during most of the cycle, reducing the electric power consumption to 10.3% and electricity costs to 11.4% by using a nature-based solution.

TI Economics of Small-scale Commercial Aquaponics in Hawai'i
SO JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Aquaponics, the symbiotic integration of aquaculture and hydroponics, has been touted as a sustainable food production technology. While there is anecdotal evidence, there are only a few studies on the economics of commercial aquaponics. In this study, we collect economic and production information from three aquaponic farms to investigate the economic feasibility of an aquaponics industry in Hawaii. Based on the information supplied by the farms, we develop a model case to analyze (i) profitability, (ii) return on investment, and (iii) input requirements for small-scale commercial aquaponics operation in Hawaii. We find that small-scale commercial aquaponics is economically feasible, but our findings are not as optimistic as those previously published. The modified internal rate of return of the model farm is 7.36%. We conduct sensitivity and decision reversal analysis to investigate how output prices and operational cost parameters affect the overall economic outcome. We find that economic outcome is very sensitive to output price. Investment in commercial aquaponics cannot be supported if annual sales revenue falls by 11%. We conclude by discussing challenges and risks faced by commercial aquaponic farms and the potential economic gain from organic certification and renewable energy implementation.

AB The present study examined the effects of three recirculation rates (50%, 200% and 400%) on water quality and biomass growth at low and high fish stocking densities (122 and 220 fish/m(3)) in aquaponic systems. The system consisted of a Tilapia tank connected to a gravel filter and three hydroponic trenches in series with Ipomoed aquatica, Lactuca sativa and Canna glauca. The RRs influenced most water quality parameters with best water quality at the high R.R. At the low RR of 50% mass mortality of fish occurred due to lack of oxygen. The fish growth and survival was excellent in the high RR of 400% at the low fish density of 122 fish/m3. The plant trenches were found to be effective in removing potential harmful concentrations of NH4-N and NO2-N from the recirculating water. For each kg of fish produced in this system approximately 1.0 m(3) water was needed. During a 25-day period about 1 kg of marketable fresh biomass of L aquatica and 270 g dry weight aboveground biomass of C glauca was produced. It is concluded that high recirculation rate of the water of 200-400% per day is needed to secure a good growth and a low FCR of Tilapia in aquaponic systems. High recirculation rates also secure a good water quality. The aquaponic system has a very low effluent discharge compared to traditional aquaculture techniques, and it recycles nutrients for plant growth. Hence, aquaponic system is a promising sustainable solution that can be applied on commercial fish pond scale.

AB Many aquaculture systems generate high amounts of wastewater containing compounds such as suspended solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Today, aquaculture is imperative because fish demand is increasing. However, the load of waste is directly proportional to the fish production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more intensive fish culture with efficient systems for wastewater treatment. A number of physical, chemical and biological methods used in conventional wastewater treatment have been applied in aquaculture systems. Constructed wetlands technology is becoming more and more important in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) because wetlands have proven to be well-established and a cost-effective method for treating wastewater. This review gives an overview about possibilities to avoid the pollution of water resources; it focuses initially on the use of systems combining aquaculture and plants with a historical review of aquaculture and the treatment of its effluents. It discusses the present state, taking into account the load of pollutants in wastewater such as nitrates and phosphates, and finishes with recommendations to prevent or at least reduce the pollution of water resources in the future.

AB Aquaponics combines the hydroponic production of plants and the aquaculture production of fish into a sustainable agriculture system that uses natural biological cycles to supply nitrogen and minimizes the use of nonrenewable resources, thus providing economic benefits that can increase over time. Several production systems and media exist for producing hydroponic crops (bench bed, nutrient film technique, floating raft, rockwool, perlite, and pine bark). Critical management requirements (water quality maintenance and biofilter nitrification) for aquaculture need to be integrated with the hydroponics to successfully manage intensive aquaponic systems. These systems will be discussed with emphasis on improving sustainability through management and integration of the living components [plants and nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas spp. and Nitrobacter spp.)] and the biofilter system. Sustainable opportunities include biological nitrogen production rates of 80 to 90 g.m(-3) per day nitrate nitrogen from trickling biofilters and plant uptake of aquaculture wastewater. This uptake results in improved water and nutrient use efficiency and conservation. Challenges to sustainability center around balancing the aquaponic system environment for the optimum growth of three organisms, maximizing production outputs and minimizing effluent discharges to the environment.

AB Integrating hydroponic and aquaculture systems (aquaponics) requires balanced pH for plants, fish, and nitrifying bacteria. Nitrification prevents accumulation of fish waste ammonia by converting it to NO3--N. The difference in optimum pH for hydroponic cucumber (Cucumis sativa) (5.5 to 6.0) and nitrification (7.5 to 9.0) requires reconciliation to improve systems integration and sustainability. The purpose of this investigation was to: 1) determine the ammonia biofiltration rate of a perlite trickling biofilter/root growth medium in an aquaponic system, 2) predict the relative contribution of nitrifiers and plants to ammonia biofiltration, and 3) establish the reconciling pH for ammonia biofiltration and cucumber yield in recirculating aquaponics. The biofiltration rate of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal was 19,31, and 80 g.m(-3).d(-1) for aquaponic systems [cucumber, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp. + Nitrobacter sp.)] with operating pH at 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively. With the existing aquaponic design (four plants/20 L perlite biofilter/100 L tank water), the aquaponic biofilter (with plants and nitrifiers) was three times more effective at removing TAN compared with plant uptake alone at pH 6.0. Most probable number of Nitrosomonas sp. bacteria cells sampled from biofilter cores indicated that the aquaculture control (pH 7.0) had a significantly higher (0.01% level) bacteria cell number compared with treatments containing plants in the biofilter (pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0). However, the highest TAN removal was with aquaponic production at pH 8.0. Thus, operating pH was more important than nitrifying bacteria population in determining the rate of ammonia biofiltration. Early marketable cucumber fruit yield decreased linearly from 1.5 to 0.7 kg/plant as pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0, but total marketable yield was not different. The reconciling pH for this system was pH 8.0, except during production for early-season cucumber market windows in which pH 7.0 would be recommended.

AB Aquaponics - the co-production of fish and plant products - is gaining interest both by entrepreneurs and researchers. This article evaluates both the technical setup as well as the economic potential of aquaponic systems and is aimed at identifying relevant knowledge questions for further improvements. Using system requirements for hydroponic systems and aquaculture, the aquaponic system was compared to a typical Dutch rockwool system. Aquaponics was found to be an improvement on current practices when using Deep Flow Technique (cultivation in a flowing thick water layer), resulting in better nutrient availability for the plants and re-use of nitrate. However, the technical challenges of the direct linkage between the two production systems in terms of needed technology and disease management was found to make the total system suboptimal when compared to conventional practices. The technological advantages of efficiency in use of land and energy and re-use of nutrients were found to be a marginal cost reduction of 1.2%. The article concludes that the added value of aquaponics can be found in the total business concept of producing in an urban environment with direct relationship with consumers. Further improvement of aquaponics can be found in improved disease management of the system - through management or improved design.

ID RECIRCULATING AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; GROWTH; PH
AB Aquaponics is the science of integrating intensive fish aquaculture with plant production in recirculating water systems. Although ion waste production by fish cannot satisfy all plant requirements, less is known about the relationship between total feed provided for fish and the production of milliequivalents (mEq) of different macronutrients for plants, especially for nutrient flow hydroponics used for strawberry production in Spain. That knowledge is essential to consider the amount of macronutrients available in aquaculture systems so that farmers can estimate how much nutrient needs to be supplemented in the waste water from fish, to produce viable plant growth. In the present experiment, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) were grown in a small-scale recirculating system at two different densities while growth and feed consumption were noted every week for five weeks. At the same time points, water samples were taken to measure pH, EC25, HCO3-, Cl-, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, H2PO4-, SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ build up. The total increase in mEq of each ion per kg of feed provided to the fish was highest for NO3-, followed, in decreasing order, by Ca2+, H2PO4-, K+, Mg2+ and SO42-. The total amount of feed required per mEq ranged from 1.61-13.1 kg for the four most abundant ions (NO3-, Ca2+, H2PO4-, and K+) at a density of 2 kg fish m(-3), suggesting that it would be rather easy to maintain small populations of fish to reduce the cost of hydroponic solution supplementation for strawberries.

In this study, the fate of nitrogen in floating-raft aquaponic systems with two plant species, pak choi (Brassica rapa L. chinensis) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa longifolia cv. Jericho), and tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) was evaluated using mass balance and natural abundance nitrogen isotopic compositions. Dissolved oxygen (DO) levels associated with hydraulic loading rate (HLR) were found to positively affect nitrite oxidation rate. Increase in nitrite concentration was observed in recirculating water under low DO levels. Nitrite is an intermediate in the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to N-2 gas. Based on progressive enrichment of N-15 of nitrate with time in the recirculating water, we estimated total nitrogen loss of up to 46.3% via denitrification. Nitrogen loss via denitrification was reduced by 44-56% when the feed-to-plant ratio was decreased by 30%. Results of this study provide better understanding of nitrogen transformations, which could help in designing and operating efficient aquaponic systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, aquaponic systems have gained significant popularity as soilless agriculture systems for organic fruits and vegetables production with concomitant remediation of aquaculture effluent. Aquaponics is a potential sustainable food production system that integrates aquaculture with hydroponics in which nitrogen-rich effluent from the fish production is utilized for plant growth. Because nitrogen is one of the most important inputs in an aquaponic system, it is critical to investigate the nitrogen transformations in the system for enhanced recovery of resources. Since studies on nitrogen transformations and nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) in aquaponic systems have been very limited, this review critically examines the important fates of nitrogen from input to outputs (e.g., ammonia nitrogen generation, nitrification, nitrate assimilation and nitrogen loss) to improve NUE in aquaponic systems. Various factors affecting the nitrogen transformations are also discussed. Furthermore, an example of nitrogen imbalance between nitrate uptake and nitrate generation rates in an aquaponic system was demonstrated. This review aims to advance our current understanding of nitrogen transformations and outlines future research needs in aquaponic systems, a sustainable model for efficient water and nutrient managements, and food production.

AB To investigate the effects of pH on performance and nitrogen transformations in aquaponics, media-based aquaponics operated at pH 6.0, 7.5 and 9.0 were systematically examined and compared in this study. Results showed that nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) reached its maximum of 50.9% at pH 6.0, followed by 47.3% at pH 7.5 and 44.7% at pH 9.0. Concentrations of nitrogen compounds (i.e., TAN, NO2-N and NO3-N) in three pH systems were all under tolerable levels. pH had significant effect on N2O emission and N2O conversion ratio decreased from 2.0% to 0.6% when pH increased from 6.0 to 9.0, mainly because acid environment would inhibit denitrifiers and lead to higher N2O emission. 75.2-78.5% of N2O emission from aquaponics was attributed to denitrification. In general, aquaponics was suggested to maintain pH at 6.0 for high NUE, and further investigations on N2O mitigation strategy are needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aquaponics has attracted worldwide attention in recent years and is considered as an alternative technology for conventional aquaculture. In this study, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and pakchoi (Brassica chinensis) were cultured in lab-scale aquaponics, and attempts were conducted to enhance its nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) through two optimization methods, i.e., nitrifies addition (NA) and filler gradation (FG). Results showed that NA and FG could improve the NUE of aquaponics by 8.8 and 16.0 %, respectively, compared with control. The total ammonia (TAN) and nitrite (NO2 (-)) concentrations in NA and FG systems were maintained at relatively low level (TAN < 0.5 mg/L, NO2 (-) < 0.1 mg/L), which demonstrated that both the NA and FG could provide non-toxic water environment for fish culture. Nitrous oxide conversion ratio of the control, NA, and FG were 0.8, 1.2, and 1.7 %, respectively, indicating that media-based aquaponics also contributed to global warming. Although the two proposed attempts in this study caused more N2O emission, they made new breakthrough in improving the NUE of aquaponics.
