The use of membrane desalination has increased as materials have improved and costs have decreased. Today, reverse osmosis membranes are the leading technology for new desalination installations, and they are applied to a variety of salt water resources using tailored pretreatment and membrane system design. Two distinct branches of reverse osmosis desalination have emerged: seawater reverse osmosis and brackish water reverse osmosis. Differences between the two water sources, including foulants, salinity, waste brine (concentrate) disposal options, and plant location, have created significant differences in process development, implementation, and key technical problems. Pretreatment options are similar for both types of reverse osmosis and depend on the specific components of the water source. Both brackish water and seawater reverse osmosis (RO) will continue to be used worldwide; new technology in energy recovery and renewable energy, as well as innovative plant design, will allow greater use of desalination for inland and rural communities, while providing more affordable water for large coastal cities. A wide variety of research and general information on RO desalination is available; however, a direct comparison of seawater and brackish water RO systems is necessary to highlight similarities and differences in process development. This article brings to light key parameters of an RO process and process modifications due to feed water characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The phylogenetic composition of these communities is defined by relatively few bacterial phyla, including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. A synthesis of available data suggests a two-step selection process by which the bacterial microbiota of roots is differentiated from the surrounding soil biome. Rhizodeposition appears to fuel an initial substrate-driven community shift in the rhizosphere, which converges with host genotype-dependent fine-tuning of microbiota profiles in the selection of root endophyte assemblages. Substrate-driven selection also underlies the establishment of phyllosphere communities but takes place solely at the immediate leaf surface. Both the leaf and root microbiota contain bacteria that provide indirect pathogen protection, but root microbiota members appear to serve additional host functions through the acquisition of nutrients from soil for plant growth. Thus, the plant microbiota emerges as a fundamental trait that includes mutualism enabled through diverse biochemical mechanisms, as revealed by studies on plant growth-promoting and plant health-promoting bacteria. © Copyright ©2013 by Annual Reviews.

Approximately 1,900 insect species are eaten worldwide, mainly in developing countries. They constitute quality food and feed, have high feed conversion ratios, and emit low levels of greenhouse gases. Some insect species can be grown on organic side streams, reducing environmental contamination and transforming waste into high-protein feed that can replace increasingly more expensive compound feed ingredients, such as fish meal. This requires the development of cost-effective, automated mass-rearing facilities that provide a reliable, stable, and safe product. In the tropics, sustainable harvesting needs to be assured and rearing practices promoted, and in general, the food resource needs to be revalorized. In the Western world, consumer acceptability will relate to pricing, perceived environmental benefits, and the development of tasty insect-derived protein products. © 2013 by Annual Reviews.

Measurements at lab-scale and full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have demonstrated that N2O can be emitted in substantial amounts during nitrogen removal in WWTPs, however, a large variation in reported emission values exists. Analysis of literature data enabled the identification of the most important operational parameters leading to N2O emission in WWTPs: (i) low dissolved oxygen concentration in the nitrification and denitrification stages, (ii) increased nitrite concentrations in both nitrification and denitrification stages, and (iii) low COD/N ratio in the denitrification stage. From the literature it remains unclear whether nitrifying or denitrifying microorganisms are the main source of N2O emissions. Operational strategies to prevent N2O emission from WWTPs are discussed and areas in which further research is urgently required are identified. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The resultant water pollution concerns have been the main driver for sustainable phosphorus use (including phosphorus recovery). However the emerging global challenge of phosphorus scarcity with serious implications for future food security, means phosphorus will also need to be recovered for productive reuse as a fertilizer in food production to replace increasingly scarce and more expensive phosphate rock. Through an integrated and systems framework, this paper examines the full spectrum of sustainable phosphorus recovery and reuse options (from small-scale low-cost to large-scale high-tech), facilitates integrated decision-making and identifies future opportunities and challenges for achieving global phosphorus security. Case studies are provided rather than focusing on a specific technology or process. There is no single solution to achieving a phosphorus-secure future: in addition to increasing phosphorus use efficiency, phosphorus will need to be recovered and reused from all current waste streams throughout the food production and consumption system (from human and animal excreta to food and crop wastes). There is a need for new sustainable policies, partnerships and strategic frameworks to develop renewable phosphorus fertilizer systems for farmers. Further research is also required to determine the most sustainable means in a given context for recovering phosphorus from waste streams and converting the final products into effective fertilizers, accounting for life cycle costs, resource and energy consumption, availability, farmer accessibility and pollution. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Food security; Global phosphorus scarcity; Phosphorus recovery and reuse; Sustainability; Systems framework,Agriculture; Behavioral research; Costs; Decision making; Energy utilization; Fertilizers; Food supply; Life cycle; Phosphate deposits; Recovery; Sustainable development; Systems engineering; Water pollution; Food security; Global phosphorus cycle; Global phosphorus scarcity; Implications for futures; Integrated decision makings; Phosphorus recovery; Phosphorus use efficiencies; Systems framework; Phosphorus; phosphate fertilizer; phosphorus; decision making; energy efficiency; excretion; fertilizer; food production; food security; hydrosphere; mobility; phosphate rock; phosphorus cycle; sustainability; water pollution; article; decision making; energy conservation; energy resource; food industry; food intake; food security; human; manure; nonhuman; pollution control; product recovery; recycling; waste water treatment plant; Animalia,"Cordell, D.; Institute for Sustainable Futures, PO Box 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; email: Dana.Cordell@uts.edu.au",,Elsevier Ltd,456535,,CMSHA,21414650,English,Chemosphere,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960288320

Recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs) provide opportunities to reduce water usage and to improve waste management and nutrient recycling. RAS makes intensive fish production compatible with environmental sustainability. This review aims to summarize the most recent developments within RAS that have contributed to the environmental sustainability of the European aquaculture sector. The review first shows the ongoing expansion of RAS production by species and country in Europe. Life cycle analysis showed that feed, fish production and waste and energy are the principal components explaining the ecological impact of RAS. Ongoing developments in RAS show two trends focusing on: (1) technical improvements within the recirculation loop and (2) recycling of nutrients through integrated farming. Both trends contributed to improvements in the environmental sustainability of RAS. Developments within the recirculation loop that are reviewed are the introduction of denitrification reactors, sludge thickening technologies and the use of ozone. New approached towards integrated systems include the incorporation of wetlands and algal controlled systems in RAS. Finally, the review identifies the key research priorities that will contribute to the future reduction of the ecological impact of RAS. Possible future breakthroughs in the fields of waste production and removal might further enhance the sustainabilty of fish production in RAS. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Denitrification; Ecological impact; Intensive systems; Waste; Water re-use,Controlled system; Denitrification reactors; Ecological impacts; Environmental sustainability; Fish production; Integrated farming; Integrated systems; Intensive systems; Life cycle analysis; Nutrient recycling; Possible futures; Principal Components; Production system; Re-circulation loops; Recirculating aquaculture system; Research priorities; Sludge thickening; Technical improvement; Waste production; Water re-use; Water usage; Aquaculture; Denitrification; Ecology; Energy conversion; Nutrients; Ozone; Principal component analysis; Sustainable development; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water recycling; Water resources; Waste management; denitrification; ecological impact; environmental economics; life cycle analysis; ozone; recycling; sustainable development; waste management; Europe; algae,"Martins, C.I.M.; CCMAR - Centro de Ciências do Mar, Campus de Gambelas, P-8005-139, Faro, Portugal; email: cimartins@ualg.pt",,,1448609,,AQEND,,English,Aquac.

Our purpose is to provide a framework that will guide research, education, and action in the multiple and interacting facets of an increasingly complex global agriculture and food system. To accomplish such goals, it is essential to build bridges and connections among and beyond our disciplines in production agriculture, as well as beyond the farm gate into the rural landscape and community. Fields of sociology, anthropology, environmental sciences, ethics, and economics are crucial to the mix. They provide additional vantage points from which we can view the food system anew, as well as insights on how to establish valuation criteria beyond neoclassical economics. Examples from Mexico, California, and the Nordic Region are used to illustrate the successful implementation of this educational strategy in universities. Design of individual farms using principles of ecology is expanded to the levels of landscape, community, and bioregion, with emphasis on uniqueness of place and the people and other species that inhabit that place. We conclude that defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems will foster the development of broader interdisciplinary research teams and attractive systems-based courses for tomorrow's best students. In contrast to the narrow focus on crop-soil interactions, this definition will help us raise higher-level research questions whose solutions will advance the development of a sustainable agriculture and food system.

The effectiveness of the nitrification process can be evaluated by nitrification kinetics. Nitrification in the bacterial film of the biofilter involves physical, chemical and biological processes that are governed by a variety of parameters such as substrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations, organic matters, temperature, pH, alkalinity, salinity and turbulence level. The impacts of these parameters upon nitrification kinetics make predicting the performance of a biofilter for a given application an engineering challenge. Knowing the performance of a biofilter is critical for both designers and managers. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on nitrification kinetics as affected by the aforementioned factors based on literature and the results from the authors' laboratories. These factors were ranked according to their significance of impact on biofilter nitrification performance.

Little is known about the growth parameters of Nitrospira or the effects of environmental conditions or inhibitory compounds on Nitrospira activity. These bacterial properties were investigated using an enriched Nitrospira culture and an enriched Nitrobacter culture or Nitrobacter literature values. Compared to Nitrobacter, Nitrospira was found to have a comparable optimal pH range (8.0-8.3); similar normalised activity-temperature relationship (0.44e0.055(T-15)) for temperatures between 15 and 30 °C and a similar oxygen half-saturation constant, KO (0.54±0.14 mg L-1). The major differences identified were that Nitrospira had a lower nitrite half-saturation constant, KS (0.9±0.07 mg NO2-N L-1); lower inhibition threshold concentrations for free ammonia (between 0.04 and 0.08 mg NH3-N L-1) and free nitrous acid (less than 0.03 mg HNO2-N L-1) and a higher yield (0.15±0.04 g VSS g N-1). Therefore, Nitrospira is more likely to dominate nitrite oxidation under conditions with low ammonium and nitrite concentrations, which would provide an advantage to them due to their lower KS value while avoiding any free ammonia or free nitrous acid inhibition. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In an aquaponic RAS established in Waedenswil, Zurich, the potential of three crop plants was assessed to recycle nutrients from fish wastewater. A special design of trickling filters was used to provide nitrification of fish wastewater: Light-expanded clay aggregate (LECA) was filled in a layer of 30 cm in vegetable boxes, providing both surface for biofilm growth and cultivation area for crop plants. Aubergine, tomato and cucumber cultures were established in the LECA filter and nutrient removal rates calculated during 42-105 days. The highest nutrient removal rates by fruit harvest were achieved during tomato culture: over a period of &gt;3 months, fruit production removed 0.52, 0.11 and 0.8 gm-2d-1 for N, P and K in hydroponic and 0.43, 0.07 and 0.4 gm-2d-1 for N, P and K in aquaponic. In aquaponic, 69% of nitrogen removal by the overall system could thus be converted into edible fruits. Plant yield in aquaponic was similar to conventional hydroponic production systems. The experiments showed that nutrient recycling is not a luxury reserved for rural areas with litlle space limitation; instead, the additionally occupied surface generates income by producing marketable goods. By converting nutrients into biomass, treating wastewater could become a profitable business. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Box 2503 Ullandhaug, Stavanger N-4091, Norway","This review aims to identify and examine realistic aquaculture waste solids management strategies. The main reason for treating solids to be discharged from flow-through systems is to reduce potential negative impacts on the surrounding aquatic environment. In reuse and recycle systems, solids management will be required to maintain culture water quality. In such cases, solids management will often be designed to be combined with other unit processes. Solids concentrations in the untreated effluent from flow-though farms are low at around 5-50 mg l-1, and do not appear to have altered greatly within the last 20 years. These solids can commonly carry 7-32% of the total nitrogen and 30-84% of the total phosphorus in the wastewater. Feed quality and feeding management can be manipulated to reduce the quantity of waste solids produced. Decreases in the specific water consumption within a farm, increase the concentration of solids in the effluent, which results in an increase in particle separation efficiency. Particles should be separated from the culture stock and the primary effluent flow quickly and efficiently (i.e. at high solids concentrations). This can be achieved by within-tank separation systems, often comprising a separate low-flow particle outlet. Rotating microscreens are commonly used at land-based intensive fish-farms in Europe. Screen mesh pore sizes of 60-200 μm are common. There is little advantage in using pore sizes smaller than 60 μm. Low concentration aquaculture solids usually settle discretely in sedimentation tanks, i.e. with no agglomeration of particles that would increase their settling velocity. Such basins are prone to many technical problems, and in most situations are unlikely to be suitable for the treatment of solids in the primary wastewater from aquaculture facilities. Sedimentation basins may be appropriate for secondary de-watering or thickening. Overflow rates of 1.0-2.7 m3 m-2 h-1 have been reported. Bead filters and flotation columns have been shown to perform well for solids removal in limited flow-rate recycle systems. The sludge produced by separation technology can be thickened and stabilised by the addition of lime, to kill pathogenic diseases and restrict putrefaction. The resulting sludge has been spread on agricultural land. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",Aquaculture; Effluent; Particles; Solids; Treatment; Wastewater,aquaculture; dewatering; effluent; environmental protection; Europe; filter; flotation; nitrogen; particle; phosphorus; sedimentation; sludge conditioning; solid waste; waste management; waste minimization; waste water recycling; aquaculture; liquid-solid separation; production system; sludge; solid waste; waste management,,,,1448609,,,,English,Aquac.

The most commonly raised aquatic animals by percent were tilapia (69%), ornamental fish (43%), catfish (25%), other aquatic animals (18%), perch (16%), bluegill (15%), trout (10%), and bass (7%). Production statistics, gross sales revenue, investments, and sales outlets for operations are reported and compared to other fields of aquaculture and agriculture. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to study which factors were associated with profitability (as a binary outcome) in the past 12. months. Several factors were significantly associated with profitability: aquaponics as the respondents' primary source of income (p. <. 0.01; Odds Ratio: 5.79; 95% Confidence Interval: 3.8-9.0), location in US Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 7-13 (p. <. 0.01; OR: 4.17; 95% CI: 3.2-5.5), gross sales revenue ≥$5000 (p. <. 0.01; OR: 3.58; 95% CI: 2.2-5.8), greater aquaponics knowledge (p. <. 0.01; OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 2.0-2.9), and sales of non-food products (e.g., supplies, materials, consulting services, workshops, and agrotourism) (p. =. 0.028; OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.1-4.2).

In developing countries, this phenomenon is exacerbated by poverty, leading to tremendous problems of employment, immigration from the rural areas, transportation, food supply and environment protection. Simultaneously with the growth of cities, a new type of agriculture has emerged; namely, urban agriculture. Here, the main functions of urban agriculture are described: its social roles, the economic functions as part of its multi-functionality, the constraints, and the risks for human consumption and the living environment. We highlight the following major points. (1) Agricultural activity will continue to be a strong contributor to urban households. Currently, differences between rural and urban livelihood households appear to be decreasing. (2) Urban agricultural production includes aquaculture, livestock and plants. The commonest crops are perishable leafy vegetables, particularly in South-east Asia and Africa. These vegetable industries have short marketing chains with lower price differentials between farmers and consumers than longer chains. The city food supply function is one of the various roles and objectives of urban agriculture that leads to increasing dialogue between urban dwellers, city authorities and farmers. (3) One of the farmers' issues is to produce high quality products in highly populated areas and within a polluted environment. Agricultural production in cities faces the following challenges: access to the main agricultural inputs, fertilizers and water; production in a polluted environment; and limitation of its negative impact on the environment. Urban agriculture can reuse city wastes, but this will not be enough to achieve high yields, and there is still a risk of producing unsafe products. These are the main challenges for urban agriculture in keeping its multi-functional activities such as cleansing, opening up the urban space, and producing fresh and nutritious food. © 2009 INRA, EDP Sciences.",Freshness; Livelihoods; Marketing chains; Multi-functional; Urban and peri-urban agriculture; Vegetables,agricultural production; alternative agriculture; developing world; employment; environmental protection; food supply; immigration; leafy vegetable; population density; poverty; rural area; sustainable development; transportation; urban agriculture; Africa; Asia,"De Bon, H.; Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique Pour le Developpement (CIRAD), TA B-103/PS4, Boulevard de la Lironde, 34398 Montpellier Cedex 5, France; email: hubert.de_bon@cirad.fr",,,17740746,,,,English,Agron.

Box 101, DK-9850 Hirtshals, Denmark","Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have gained increasing interest in recent years as a means to intensify fish production while at the same time minimize the environmental impact. Considerable hands-on experience has accumulated within the Nordic countries over the last 20-30 years in designing, building, and operating intensive land-based RAS for different species. This study compiles and assesses published literature along with un-published hands-on experiences with rearing different species in RAS in the Nordic countries, including Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), European eel (Anguilla anguilla), pike perch (Stizostedion lucioperca), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), sturgeon (order Acipenseriformes), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and European lobster (Homarus gammarus). High capital costs are one of the biggest challenges to sustainable RAS calling for large scale intensive productions to reduce investment and operation costs. Consistent with this, production of Atlantic salmon smolts in indoor RAS and rainbow trout in outdoor Model-Trout-Farms (MTFs) have been the commercially most successful productions so far. Aside from end-of-pipe treatment including sludge handling and efficient nitrogen removal, much of the RAS technology applied is well known and is, as such, more or less ready to apply for culturing a variety of species. Successful production of "" new"" species in RAS therefore largely comes down to identifying the biological requirements of that specific species, and designing the RAS to fulfill and support the specific requirements. Well established brood-stocks and continuous supply of offspring is furthermore a prerequisite for successful RAS production of most species. Successful operations of less intensive RAS such as aquaponic systems appear to be feasible primarily when culturing more exotic species targeted for selected customers. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Hands-on experience; Intensive RAS; RAS in operation; Rearing conditions; Water quality,Future perspectives; Hands-on experience; Intensive RAS; Oreochromis niloticus; Rainbow trouts (Oncorhynchus mykiss); RAS in operation; Rearing conditions; Recirculating aquaculture system; Water quality; Environmental impact; advanced technology; cost-benefit analysis; environmental impact; future prospect; intensive culture; literature review; lobster culture; rearing; recirculating system; salmonid culture; sludge; sustainable development; water quality; water treatment; Scandinavia; Acipenseriformes; Anguilla; Anguilla anguilla; Esocidae; Homarus gammarus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oreochromis niloticus; Salmo salar; Salmonidae; Salvelinus alpinus; Stizostedion lucioperca,"Dalsgaard, J.; Technical University of Denmark, P.O.

Box 12, Rehovot 76100, Israel","Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are operated as outdoor or indoor systems. Due to the intensive mode of fish production in many of these systems, waste treatment within the recirculating loop as well as in the effluents of these systems is of primary concern. In outdoor RAS, such treatment is often achieved within the recirculating loop. In these systems, extractive organisms, such as phototrophic organisms and detritivores, are cultured in relatively large treatment compartments whereby a considerable part of the waste produced by the primary organisms is converted in biomass. In indoor systems, capture of solid waste and conversion of ammonia to nitrate by nitrification are usually the main treatment steps within the recirculating loop. Waste reduction (as opposed to capture and conversion) is accomplished in some freshwater and marine indoor RAS by incorporation of denitrification and sludge digestion. In many RAS, whether operated as indoor or outdoor systems, effluent is treated before final discharge. Such effluent treatment may comprise devices for sludge thickening, sludge digestion as well as those for inorganic phosphate and nitrogen removal. Whereas waste disposed from freshwater RAS may be treated in regional waste treatment facilities or may be used for agricultural purposes in the form of fertilizer or compost, treatment options for waste disposed from marine RAS are more limited. In the present review, estimations of waste production as well as methods for waste reduction in the recirculating loop and effluents of freshwater and marine RAS are presented. Emphasis is placed on those processes leading to waste reduction rather than those used for waste capture and conversion. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Onsite treatment; RAS; Recirculating aquaculture systems; Waste disposal; Waste production; Waste treatment,Agricultural purpose; Inorganic phosphates; Onsite treatment; Phototrophic organisms; RAS; Recirculating aquaculture system; Recirculating loop; Waste production; Aquaculture; Biology; Composting; Effluent treatment; Sludge digestion; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Water; Effluents; ammonia; aquaculture effluent; compost; denitrification; detritivory; nitrate; photoautotrophy; recirculating system; sludge; solid waste; waste disposal; waste treatment,"Van Rijn, J.; Department of Animal Sciences, P.O.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop more intensive fish culture with efficient systems for wastewater treatment. A number of physical, chemical and biological methods used in conventional wastewater treatment have been applied in aquaculture systems. Constructed wetlands technology is becoming more and more important in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) because wetlands have proven to be well-established and a cost-effective method for treating wastewater.

In these systems fish is cultured next to other organisms, which are converting otherwise discharged nutrients into valuable products. These conversions are analyzed based on nitrogen and phosphorous balances using a mass balance approach. The analytical concept of this review comprises a hypothetical system design with five modules: (1) the conversion of feed nutrients into fish biomass, the ""Fish-Biomass- Converter""; (2) the separation of solid and dissolved fish waste/nutrients; the ""Fish-Waste-Processor""; (3) the conversion of dissolved fish waste/nutrients, the ""Phototrophic-herbivore-Converter""; (4 and 5) the conversion of solid fish waste, the ""Bacterial-Waste-Converter"", or the ""Detrivorous-Converter"". In the reviewed examples, fish culture alone retains 20-50% feed nitrogen (N) and 15-65% feed phosphorous (P). The combination of fish culture with phototrophic conversion increases nutrient retention of feed N by 15-50% and feed P by up to 53%. If in addition herbivore consumption is included, nutrient retention decreases by 60-85% feed N and 50-90% feed P. This is according to the general observation of nutrient losses from one trophic level to the next. The conversion of nutrients into bacteria and detrivorous worm biomass contributes only in smaller margins (e.g. 7% feed N and 6% feed P and 0.06% feed N 0.03 × 10-3% feed P, respectively). All integrated modules have their specific limitations, which are related to uptake kinetics, nutrient preference, unwanted conversion processes and abiotic factors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The Murray Cod had FCR's and biomass gains that were statistically identical in all systems. Lettuce yields were good, and in terms of biomass gain and yield, followed the relationship Gravel bed > Floating > NFT, with significant differences seen between all treatments. The NFT treatment was significantly less efficient than the other two treatments in terms of nitrate removal (20% less efficient), whilst no significant difference was seen between any test treatments in terms of phosphate removal. In terms of dissolved oxygen, water replacement and conductivity, no significant differences were observed between any test treatments. Overall, results suggest that NFT hydroponic sub-systems are less efficient at both removing nutrients from fish culture water and producing plant biomass or yield than Gravel bed or Floating hydroponic sub-systems in an Aquaponic context. Aquaponic system designers need to take these differences into account when designing hydroponic components within aquaponic systems. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.",Aquaponic; Biological nutrient removal; Hydroponic; Murray Cod; NFT; Nitrate; Phosphate; Waste water,aquaculture; hydroponics; nitrate; phosphate; wastewater; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa; Maccullochella peelii peelii,"Lennard, W.A.; School of Applied Sciences, Plenty Road 71, Bundoora, VIC 3083, Australia; email: S8702774@student.rmit.edu.au",,,9676120,,,,English,Aquac.

Fish production performance, plant growth and nutrient removal were measured and their dependence on hydraulic loading rate (HLR) was assessed. Fish production did not differ significantly between hydraulic loading rates. In contrast to the fish production, the water spinach yield was significantly higher in the lower hydraulic loading rate. Fish production, plant growth and percentage nutrient removal were highest at hydraulic loading rate of 1.28 m/day. The ratio of fish to plant production has been calculated to balance nutrient generation from fish with nutrient removal by plants and the optimum ratio was 15-42 gram of fish feed/m2 of plant growing area. Each unit in RAS was evaluated in terms of oxygen demand. Using specified feeding regime, mass balance equations were applied to quantify the waste discharges from rearing tanks and treatment units.

The aim of this study was to document and analyze the production methods, experiences, motivations, and demographics of aquaponics practitioners in the United States (US) and internationally. The survey was distributed online using a chain sampling method that relied on referrals from initial respondents, with 809 respondents meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority of respondents were from the US (80%), male (78%), and had at least a high school degree (91%). The mean age of respondents was 47±13 years old. Most respondents (52%) had three years or less of aquaponics experience. Respondents typically raised tilapia or ornamental fish and a variety of leafy green vegetables, herbs, and fruiting crops. Respondents were most often motivated to become involved in aquaponics to grow their own food, for environmental sustainability reasons, and for personal health reasons. Many respondents employed more than one method to raise crops, and used alternative or environmentally sustainable sources of energy, water, and fish feed. In general, our findings suggest that aquaponics is a dynamic and rapidly growing field with participants who are actively experimenting with and adopting new technologies. Additional research and outreach is needed to evaluate and communicate best practices within the field. This survey is the first large-scale effort to track aquaponics in the US and provides information that can better inform policy, research, and education efforts regarding aquaponics as it matures and possibly evolves into a mainstream form of agriculture. © 2014 Love et al.",,"adult; aged; animal food; aquaponics; article; controlled study; crop production; demography; energy resource; environmental sustainability; farming system; female; food industry; fruiting; health behavior; herb; human; international cooperation; leafy green vegetable; male; middle aged; motivation; ornamental species; personal experience; pisciculture; sampling; Tilapia; United States; vegetable; water supply; young adult; animal; aquaculture; fish; growth, development and aging; hydroponics; Internet; procedures; questionnaire; trends; Animals; Aquaculture; Fishes; Humans; Hydroponics; Internet; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Vegetables",,,Public Library of Science,19326203,,POLNC,25029125,English,PLoS ONE,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904315355

The results show that the impact of temperature on fixed film nitrification rate is less significant than that predicted by the van't Hoff-Arrhenius equation. In a fixed film biofilter, the impact of temperature on nitrification rate due to DO (dissolved oxygen) limitation is different from that due to TAN (total ammonia nitrogen) limitation. Sensitivity analysis indicated that a temperature increment at 20 °C resulted in nitrification rate increase of 1.108% per °C and 4.275% per °C under DO and TAN limited conditions, respectively. Diffusion mass transport plays an important role in fixed film nitrification processes. Consequently, the effect of temperature on nitrification rate due to bacterial growth rate change in fixed film processes is greatly reduced compared with that of suspended growth processes. When oxygen is limited, the decrease in saturation DO concentration as temperature increases results in a negative temperature impact upon the nitrification rate. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

These studies could not conclusively determine the causative agent of the health and welfare issues, but accumulation of mean nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) to approximately 100mg/L was determined to be a potential cause of abnormal swimming behaviors such as ""side swimming"" and rapid swimming velocity. A subsequent controlled, 3-month study was conducted to determine if NO3-N concentrations of 80-100mg/L resulted in chronic health issues for rainbow trout. Equal numbers of rainbow trout (16.4±0.3g) were stocked within six replicated 9.5m3 WRAS. Three WRAS were maintained with a mean NO3-N concentration of 30mg/L (""low"") resulting from nitrification, and three WRAS were maintained with a mean concentration of 91mg/L (""high"") via continuous dosing of a sodium nitrate stock solution in addition to nitrification. All six WRAS were operated with equal water exchange (1.3 days mean hydraulic retention time) and mean feed loading rates (0.72kgfeed/m3 daily makeup flow), which provided enough flushing to limit the accumulation of other water quality concentrations. Rainbow trout growth was not significantly impacted by the high NO3-N treatment. Cumulative survival for fish cultured within the high NO3-N WRAS was lower and bordered statistical significance, which resulted in total rainbow trout biomass that was significantly lower for this group at study's end. In addition, a significantly greater prevalence of side swimming rainbow trout occurred in the high NO3-N treatment, as was observed during previous research. Swimming speeds were generally greater for rainbow trout cultured in the high NO3-N treatment, but were not always significantly different. Although most water quality variables were controlled, significant differences between treatments for the concentrations of other water quality parameters inhibited definitive conclusions regarding the effect of NO3-N. However, due to the unlikely toxicity of confounding water quality parameters, study results provided strong evidence that relatively low NO3-N levels, 80-100mg/L, were related to chronic health and welfare impacts to juvenile rainbow trout under the described conditions. © 2014 The Authors.",Chronic toxicity; Nitrate; Nitrate toxicity; Rainbow trout; Recirculating aquaculture systems,Chronic toxicity; Hydraulic retention time; Rainbow trout; Recirculating aquaculture system; Statistical significance; Swimming velocities; Water quality parameters; Water quality variables; Aquaculture; Health; Nitrates; Nitrification; Toxicity; Water quality; Loading; aquaculture; concentration (composition); fish; growth response; health monitoring; juvenile; nitrate; nitrification; survivorship; swimming behavior; water quality,"Davidson, J.; The Conservation Fund's Freshwater Institute, 1098 Turner Road, Shepherdstown, WV 25443, United States; email: j.davidson@freshwaterinstitute.org",,,1448609,,AQEND,,English,Aquac.

Common carp, grass carp and silver carp were stocked in the rearing tanks at 15, 20 and 15fishm-3, respectively. The fish were fed three times daily with a pellet diet containing 46% protein. Fourteen days old tomatoes seedlings were transplanted on to growth bed units of aquaponic and hydroponic systems after stocking of carp fish for 2.5 months in the rearing tanks. Foliar nutrients application began 30 days after transplantation. Eight treatments were used, untreated control, foliar application at the rate of 250mLplant-1 with 0.5gL-1K2SO4, MgSO4·7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, MnSO4·H2O, H3BO3, ZnCl2, and CuSO4·5H2O. Plants were sprayed twice a month. The results showed that biomass gains of tomatoes were higher in hydroponics as compared to aquaponics. Foliar application of K, Mg, Fe, Mn, and B increased vegetative growth of plants in the aquaponics. In the hydroponics, only Fe and B had positive effects on plant growth. Cluster number per plant in aquaponics was lower than in hydroponics treatments, but it increased with foliar application of elements.

The system consisted of a fish culture component, solid removal component, and hydroponic component comprising six long channels with floating styrofoam rafts for holding plants. Fish culture effluents flowed by gravity from the fish culture component to the solid removal component and then to the hydroponic component. Effluents were collected in a sump from which a 1-horsepower in-line pump recirculated the water back to the fish culture tanks at a rate of about 250 L/min. The hydroponic component performed as biofilter and effectively managed the water quality. Fish production was staggered to harvest one of the four fish tanks at regular intervals when fish attained a minimum weight of 250 g. Out of the total eight harvests in 13 mo, net fish production per harvest averaged 33.5 kg/m3 of water with an overall water consumption of 320 L/kg of fish produced along with the production of leaf lettuce at 42 heads/m2 of hydroponic surface area. Only 1.4% of the total system water was added daily to compensate the evaporation and transpiration losses. A ratio of 56 g fish feed/m2 of hydroponic surface effectively controlled nutrient buildup in the effluents.

Studies of the nutrient content in organic foods vary in results due to differences in the ground cover and maturity of the organic farming operation. Nutrient content also varies from farmer to farmer and year to year. However, reviews of multiple studies show that organic varieties do provide significantly greater levels of vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus than non-organic varieties of the same foods. While being higher in these nutrients, they are also significantly lower in nitrates and pesticide residues. In addition, with the exception of wheat, oats, and wine, organic foods typically provide greater levels of a number of important antioxidant phytochemicals (anthocyanins, flavonoids, and carotenoids). Although in vitro studies of organic fruits and vegetables consistently demonstrate that organic foods have greater antioxidant activity, are more potent suppressors of the mutagenic action of toxic compounds, and inhibit the proliferation of certain cancer cell lines, in vivo studies of antioxidant activity in humans have failed to demonstrate additional benefit.

A variety of equations have been used previously to describe the effect of temperature on rates of microbial processes. It is not clear which of these best describes the influence of temperature on nitrification rates in soil. I compared five equations for describing the effects of temperature on nitrification in two soils with very different temperature optima from a California oak woodland-annual grassland. The most appropriate equation depended on the range of temperatures being evaluated. A generalized Poisson density function best described temperature effects on nitrification rates in both soils over the range of 5 to 50°C; however, the Arrhenius equation best described temperature effects over the narrower range of soil temperatures that normally occurs in the ecosystem (5 to 28 °C). Temperature optima for nitrification in most of the soils were greater than even the highest soil temperatures recorded at the sites. A model accounting for increased maintenance energy requirements at higher temperatures demonstrates how net energy production, rather than the gross energy production from nitrification, is maximized during adaptation by nitrifier populations to soil temperatures.",ammonium oxidation; growth rate; maintenance energy; modeling; nitrification; soil nitrate; temperature,ammonium; growth rate; nitrification; oxidation; soil temperature,"Stark, J.M.; Department of Biology, , Logan, UT 84322-5305, United States",,Kluwer Academic Publishers,1682563,,BIOGE,,English,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030303224

The study was conducted to evaluate aquaponics recirculation system (ARS) performance in removing inorganic nitrogen and phosphate from aquaculture wastewater using water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) and mustard green (Brassica juncea). The results showed that water spinach was able to significantly reduce the total ammonia nitrogen, nitrite-N, nitrate-N and orthophosphate with efficiencies of 78.32-85.48%, 82.93-92.22%, 79.17-87.10%, and 75.36-84.94%, respectively, compared to mustard green that removed the nutrients in the range of 69.0-75.85% for total ammonia nitrogen, 72.49-79.34% for nitrite-N, 66.67-80.65% for nitrate-N, and 66.79-77.87% for orthophosphate. Overall results suggest that water spinach is better than mustard green in nutrient removal in the aquaponics system used due to its root structures provided more microbial attachment sites, sufficient wastewater residence time, trapping and settlement of suspended particles, surface area for pollutant adsorption, uptake, and assimilation in plant tissues. © 2011 Desalination Publications.

Sustainability can be achieved by Vermicomposting of organic matter which involves accelerated cycling of nutrients though a closed cycle whereby waste products are put to productive end use. Vermicomposting and vermifiltration are natural waste management processes relying on the use of worms to convert organic wastes to stable soil enriching compounds.

Plants strip nutrients from fish waste water and convert metabolites toxic to fish. Aquaponics is an environmental-friendly production system due to its full reuse of waste and nutrients. The research, carried out at the Experimental Farm of the University of Tuscia, compared summer yields of two romaine lettuce crops (Lactuca sativa L. 'Integral') grown on aquaponic and hydroponic floating systems. For the hydroponic treatment a nutritive solution of 1.7 dS m-1 and pH 5.5 supported plant growth. For the aquaponic system two treatments under different fish densities supplied nutrients at different concentrations. Every aquaponic treatment consisted of 3 independent 250-L tanks stocked with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.). Each fish tank fed a 1.5 m2 floating system under a 20 plant m-2 density. For the first crop 110 g and 24 g tilapia were stocked at system setup respectively under a low (5 kg m-3) and high (8 kg m-3) density and supplied nutrients with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.4 and 0.6 dS m-1. For the second crop 168 g and 90 g tilapia respectively stocked under a low (6 kg m-3) and high (20 kg m-3) stocking density raised EC levels to 0.5 and 1.0 dS m-1. Production of 2.8 kg m -2 from the first hydroponic crop was similar to the 2.7 kg m -2 assessed in the high density aquaponic treatment. Conversely the 2.3 kg m-2 measured in the low density treatment was smaller. For the second trial no differences were noticed between the 6.0 kg m-2 measured in the hydroponic system and the 5.7 and 5.6 kg m-2 assessed in the high and low-density aquaponic treatments, respectively. Nevertheless different nutrient concentrations in water affected plant mineral composition. Aquaponic leaves were poorer in phosphorus but richer in calcium, potassium magnesium and sodium.",Floating system; Integrated aquaculture; Oreochromis niloticus; Soilless agriculture; Tilapia,Lactuca; Lactuca sativa; Oreochromis niloticus; Tilapia,"Pantanella, E.; Dipartimento di Geologia e Ingegneria, via S.

Operation of the system without any discharge of water and sludge was enabled by recirculation of effluent water through two separate treatment loops, an aerobic trickling filter and a predominantly anoxic sedimentation basin, followed by a fluidized bed reactor. The fish basin was stocked for the first 6 mo with red tilapia Oreochromis niloticus x O. aureus at an initial density of 16 kg/m3. During this period salinity was raised from 0 to 20 parts per thousand. Then, gilthead seabream, stocked at an initial density of 21 kg/m3, replaced tilapia at day 167 and were cultured for an additional 225 d. Non steady-state inorganic nitrogen transformations occurred as a result of these salinity changes. After day 210, the system operated at all times with those water quality parameters considered critical for successful operation of mariculture systems, within acceptable limits. Thus ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate concentrations did not exceed 1.0-mg total ammonia-N/L, 0.5-mg NO2-N/L and 50-mg NO3-N/L, respectively. Sulfide levels in the fish basin were below detection limits and oxygen &gt; 6 mg/L after the oxygen generator was added at day 315. Ammonia, produced in the fish basin and to a lesser extent in the sedimentation basin, was converted to nitrate in the aerobic trickling filter. Nitrate removal took place in the sedimentation basin and to a lesser extent in the fluidized bed reactor. Sludge, remaining in the sedimentation basin at the end of the experimental period, accounted for 9.2% of the total feed dry matter addition to the system. The system was disease-free for the entire year and fish at harvest were of good quality. Water consumption for production of 1 kg of tilapia was 93 L and 214 L for production of 1 kg of gilthead seabream. Additional growth performance data of gilthead seabream cultured in a similar but larger system are presented. During 164 d of operation of the latter system, maximum stocking densities reached 50 kg/m3 and fish biomass production was 27.7 kg/m3. Relatively poor fish survival and growth resulted from occasional technical failures of this pilot system.",,aquaculture effluent; aquaculture system; mariculture; pollution control; recirculating system; Oreochromis; Oreochromis aureus; Oreochromis niloticus; Sparus; Sparus aurata; Sparus aurata; Tilapia,"Gelfand, I.; Department of Animal Sciences, , Rehovat 76100, Israel",,World Aquaculture Society,8938849,,,,English,J.

Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been proposed to treat this type of effluent, but little is known about the performance of these systems in treating hydroponic wastewater. In addition, obtaining satisfactory winter performances from CWs operated in cold climates remains a challenge, as biological pathways are often slowed down or inhibited. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of plant species (Typha sp., Phragmites australis, and Phalaris arundinacea) and the addition of organic carbon on nutrient removal in winter. The experimental setup consisted of 16 subsurface flow CW mesocosms (1 m2, HRT of 3 days) fed with 30 Ld1 of synthetic hydroponics wastewater, with half of the mesocosms fed with an additional source of organic carbon (sucrose). Carbon addition had a significant impact on nitrate and phosphate removal, with removal means of 4.9 g m-2d -1 of NO3-N and 0.5 g m-2 d-1 of PO4-P. Planted mesocosms were generally more efficient than unplanted controls. Furthermore, we found significant differences among plant treatments for NO3-N (highest removal with P. arundinacea) and COD (highest removal with P. australis/Typha sp.). Overall, planted wetlands with added organic carbon represent the best combination to treat hydroponics wastewater during the winter. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Constructed wetlands; Hydroponics wastewater; Macrophyte species; Nitrate removal; Organic carbon addition,Constructed wetlands; Hydroponics wastewater; Macrophytes; Nitrate removal; Organic carbon addition; Effluents; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Sugar (sucrose); Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Nitrogen removal; ammonia; nitrate; organic carbon; phosphate; constructed wetland; mesocosm; nitrate; organic carbon; subsurface flow; waste treatment; wastewater; winter; article; chemical analysis; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; denitrification; environmental impact assessment; mesocosm; nitrification; nonhuman; Phalaris arundinacea; Phragmites australis; plant; waste component removal; waste water management; wetland; winter; Phalaris arundinacea; Phragmites australis; Typha,"Brisson, J.; Institut de Recherche en Biologie Végétale, 4101, rue Sherbrooke Est, Montréal, QC H1X 2B2, Canada; email: jacques.brisson@umontreal.ca",,,496979,,WAPLA,,English,Water Air Soil Pollut.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957592480

On the other hand, interest in essential oils (EOs) as an alternative to synthetic fungicides has recently gained momentum. In this study. Cinnamomum zeylanicum EO was incorporated into a variety of commercial citrus waxes (shellac, carnauba, paraffin and polyethylene). The biological activity of these formulations against green and blue rots as well as their viscosity and adherence to the orange fruit surface were evaluated. Excellent disease control was achieved with C. zeylanicum EO incorporated in shellac and/or carnauba wax compared to other EO-wax formulations. Disease control by EO-waxes seems to depend not only on the volume that remains on the fruit skin, but also, probably on the retention of EO components on the fruit. Other factors such as formulation solubility, permeability to gases, and compatibility between EO compounds and those of waxes may also be involved in the improvement of EO efficacy. The present study may therefore allow a careful selection of appropriate waxes for the elaboration of effective EO-wax formulations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Biological activity; Citrus fruit; Essential oil; P. digitatum; Penicillium italicum; Wax,Cinnamomum verum; Citrus; Penicillium; Penicillium digitatum; Penicillium italicum,"Kouassi, K.H.S.; Phytopathology Unit, Passage des Déportés, 2, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; email: sosthenehugues@yahoo.fr",,,9255214,,PBTEE,,English,Postharvest Biol.

Application of biological control agents (BCAs) is an emerging alternative to synthetic fungicides. However, before becoming an economically feasible alternative to chemical control, BCAs have to satisfy different requirements related to biological, technological and toxicological properties. The different steps for a successful strategy of disease control (selection, production and formulation, study of mechanisms of action, ecological characterization, molecular monitoring, pilot efficacy trials, registration) are reviewed in this paper considering the antagonistic yeast Pichia anomala strain K. This strain was selected for its high and reliable antagonistic activity against B. cinerea and P. expansum on apples. The studies of mode of action and ecological fitness are emphasized because they can lead to a better efficacy of strain K. Recently advanced molecular techniques have contributed to improving knowledge on the modes of action. Thanks to the identification of genes involved in biocontrol properties, the genetic basis of action mechanisms can be understood. That approach was adopted for P. anomala strain K and led to the identification of genes coding for exo-β-1,3- glucanases implicated in the efficacy. Based on that identification, a formulation involving β-1,3-glucans was developed and applied with higher efficacy in controlled conditions. The importance of ecological characterisation is also highlighted in the context of pre-harvest application of P. anomala strain K. UV light, temperature and humidity were identified as major factors influencing the strain K population. A model taking into consideration temperature and humidity was developed and could be useful in deciding whether pre-harvest treatment is sufficient to allow fast colonization of wounds prior to the arrival of wound pathogens, or whether it is wise to apply further post-harvest treatment to increase the yeast population density. This summary presenting 20 years of work also paid attention to practical application of strain K and its integration with other methods of control. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Apples; Biological control; Botrytis; Penicillium; Pichia anomala; Post-harvest,"1,3 beta glucanase; beta 1,3 glucan; antifungal activity; apple; article; biological control agent; Botrytis cinerea; fungal strain; gene identification; humidity; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Penicillium expansum; Pichia anomala; postharvest decay; priority journal; temperature; ultraviolet radiation; Antibiosis; Botrytis; Malus; Penicillium; Pest Control, Biological; Pichia; Plant Diseases; Botryotinia fuckeliana; Botrytis; Penicillium; Penicillium expansum; Pichia anomala","Haïssam, J.

However, with the trend towards intensification, and consequently decrease in water exchange rates, these systems may accumulate substances, such as heavy metals, in the water and fish. Inductively-coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscope (ICP-MS) were used to determine Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, in the water and fish (Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus). Three RAS were used, differing in daily water exchange rates (30, 70 and 1500 l/kg feed/d). The concentrations of As, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn in the water increased with decreasing water exchange rates, suggesting an accumulation of heavy metals as more water was re-used. Such accumulation in the water was, however, not translated into accumulation in the liver and muscle. Accumulation of heavy metals was always higher in the liver than in the muscle; however, As reached 1.61 mg/kg wet weight in the muscle of fish farmed in RAS-70 l/kg feed/d. However, these levels are considerably lower than permissible safety levels for human consumption. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For the calculation, an analysis of the chemical composition of commercial feeds intended for this species in their various stages of production was conducted (N = 130). We combined this information with a meta-analysis of published data from commercial producers in Brazil about expected feed intake, feed conversion and other animal production indices, and body composition. With these data, it was possible to estimate the load. We estimated that 18% of the feed given to the animals is not consumed and is lost in the aquatic environment. The calculated average digestibility was 71.97% for the organic matter in the diet, 84.06% for protein and 54.40% for phosphorus. The estimated nutrient deposition efficiency, with respect to what was actually consumed by the tilapia, was 26.39% for organic matter, 43.25% for protein and 34.07% for phosphorus. The total nutrient load in the waste per tonne of biomass of produced tilapias was estimated to be 1040.63 kg of organic matter, 44.95 kg of nitrogen and 14.26 kg of phosphorus, representing 78%, 65% and 72% of the respective nutrient amounts supplied by the feed.

A 2 × 3 factorial experiment consisting of 2 filtration regimes (unfiltered versus partially filtered pond water) and 3 aggregates (styrofoam as control, sand, and gravel). The hydroponic units were placed on a bamboo platform across the pond surface. An earthen pond (226 m2) was stocked with 8000 hybrid catfish with an average initial weight of 6.58 ± 1.72 g. The fish were fed with commercial pelleted feeds containing 30% crude protein. Twenty-one days old lettuce seedlings were transplanted on to hydroponic units after stocking catfish for 4 months in the pond. Pond water was partially filtered by using a settling tank and filtration tank, which contained netting materials to trap solids. Lettuce plots were irrigated twice daily at 0800 and 1600 h using either filtered or unfiltered pond water for 45 min. The highest head weight and yield of lettuce were observed with plants grown on the sand media followed by gravel and the control treatments. Partially filtered pond water treatments had significantly higher lettuce yield (P &lt; 0.05) and filtration increased lettuce yield of the control, gravel and sand treatments by 87, 63 and 52%, respectively, over unfiltered water treatments. Lettuce grown on gravel and the filtered water control treatments had adequate tissue N content. Nutrient rich hybrid catfish (Clarias macrocephalus × Clarias gariepinus) pond water provides an opportunity to use it in the hydroponic vegetable production.

Nitrification prevents accumulation of fish waste ammonia by converting it to NO3 -N. The difference in optimum pH for hydroponic cucumber (Cucumis sativa) (5.5 to 6.0) and nitrification (7.5 to 9.0) requires reconciliation to improve systems integration and sustainability. The purpose of this investigation was to: 1) determine the ammonia biofiltration rate of a perlite trickling biofilter/root growth medium in an aquaponic system, 2) predict the relative contribution of nitrifiers and plants to ammonia biofiltration, and 3) establish the reconciling pH for ammonia biofiltration and cucumber yield in recirculating aquaponics. The biofiltration rate of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal was 19, 31, and 80 g·m-3·d-1 for aquaponic systems [cucumber, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp. + Nitrobacter sp.)] with operating pH at 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively. With the existing aquaponic design (four plants/20 L perlite biofilter/100 L tank water), the aquaponic biofilter (with plants and nitrifiers) was three times more effective at removing TAN compared with plant uptake alone at pH 6.0. Most probable number of Nitrosomonas sp. bacteria cells sampled from biofilter cores indicated that the aquaculture control (pH 7.0) had a significantly higher (0.01% level) bacteria cell number compared with treatments containing plants in the biofilter (pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0). However, the highest TAN removal was with aquaponic production at pH 8.0. Thus, operating pH was more important than nitrifying bacteria population in determining the rate of ammonia biofiltration. Early marketable cucumber fruit yield decreased linearly from 1.5 to 0.7 kg/plant as pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0, but total marketable yield was not different. The reconciling pH for this system was pH 8.0, except during production for early-season cucumber market windows in which pH 7.0 would be recommended.",Aquaculture; Hydroponics; Most probable number; Nitrification; Nitrifying bacteria; Sustainable agriculture,Bacteria (microorganisms); Cucumis; Cucumis sativus; Nitrobacter; Nitrobacter sp.; Nitrosomonas; Nitrosomonas sp.; Oreochromis niloticus; Tilapia,"Tyson, R.

Its development can make an important contribution to the future world food supply. There are two main types of exploitation. In the captural system, wild fish are admitted in the field with the irrigation water. In the cultural systems, chosen fish species are deliberately stocked and raised either together with the rice (rizipisciculture) or in rotation with it, the field then becoming a shallow fish pond. Widespread over the world, fish culture in rice fields is mainly concentrated in South East Asia where it has been known for centuries. In the United States of America, it has recently evolved both as a soil reclamation and a conservation scheme. In Europe, rice is more and more raised without fish for economic and technological reasons. In Madagascar on the contrary, very encouraging results have been obtained in the last decade among populations which have previously had experience with rice culture and irrigation. In the rest of Africa, it is still in the experimental stage. The necessity has not yet arisen for a more intensive use of wet rice areas but the existence there of a great potential has been fully demonstrated. The most suitable fish to be raised in rice fields have been found to be C. carpio L. and T. mossambica P et. In the USA, a buffalo fish and a catfish have been more suitable. In Africa, T. melanopleura D um. should become more popular in the future. Fish can greatly contribute to the control of algae and weeds, snails (bilharzia transmitters), and mosquitoes (malaria) where proper rice and fish cultural methods are applied. Apart from those resulting from sanitary improvements, there are many other advantages of raising fish in rice fields. One of the main disadvantages of rizipisciculture is that rice and fish are tied together. None of them can be managed the most efficiently. It may be foreseen that in the future fish will be increasingly cultivated in rotation with rice and that rizipisciculture will gradually be abandoned at least wherever agricultural economic progress takes place.

The model evaluated total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) production and removal in biofilters, identifying and quantifying the fate of nitrate nitrogen (-N) and determining the system maximum carrying capacity. Of the nitrogen input into the culture tank via feed, 83.8% was recovered from different pool: 39.4% as fish flesh (harvested), 2.1% as mortalities, 34.7% as dissolved inorganic forms of nitrogen and 7.6% as total organic nitrogen. The remaining 16.2% of nitrogen unaccounted for likely was lost as nitrogen gas due to passive denitrification and as volatization of ammonia. Average TAN in the culture tanks was 2.08 mg/L. Under current condition, system loading with fish biomass at average of 68.5% of the maximum predicted. The hydroponic troughs removal efficiency averaged 60.4% TAN per pass. From TAN production, 88% was removed in hydroponic troughs, 11% by passive nitrification and 1% by water exchange. Under conditions of reusing treated effluent with residual TAN, the hydroponic troughs work normally, while TAN in the systems did not increase noticeably. © 2013 © 2013 Balaban Desalination Publications.

Because the availability of many of these nutrients in the soil is compromised by several factors, such as soil pH, cation presence, and microbial activity, crop plants depend directly on nutrients applied as fertilizers to achieve high yields. However, the excessive use of fertilizers is a major environmental concern due to nutrient leaching that causes water eutrophication and promotes toxic algae blooms. This situation generates the urgent need for crop plants with increased nutrient use efficiency and better-designed fertilization schemes. The plant biology revolution triggered by the development of efficient gene transfer systems for plant cells together with the more recent development of next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing and other omics platforms have advanced considerably our understanding on the molecular basis of plant nutrition and how plants respond to nutritional stress. To date, genes encoding sensors, transcription factors, transporters, and metabolic enzymes have been identified as potential candidates to improve nutrient use efficiency. In addition, the study of other genetic resources, such as bacteria and fungi, allows the identification of alternative mechanisms of nutrient assimilation, which are potentially applicable in plants. Although significant progress in this respect has been achieved by conventional breeding, in this review we focus on the biotechnological approaches reported to date aimed at boosting the use of the three most limiting nutrients in the majority of arable lands: nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron. © 2013 UBC Press.",Bacterial gene; Biotechnology; Gene overexpression; Grain yield; Macronutrients; Plant nutrition,"carboxylic acid; ferritin; glutamate ammonia ligase; glutamate synthase; iron; nitrate; nitrate reductase; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; phosphite; phosphorus; phytase; transcription factor; amino acid metabolism; arable land; biosynthesis; carbon metabolism; DNA modification; genetic engineering; iron metabolism; iron transport; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen uptake; nonhuman; nutrient availability; nutrient uptake; phosphate transport; photosynthesis; plant biotechnology; plant gene; plant nutrition; plant root; priority journal; regulatory sequence; review; signal transduction; Biotechnology; Carbon; Crops, Agricultural; DNA, Plant; Ferritins; Genes, Bacterial; Genetic Engineering; Genetic Techniques; Iron; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Phosphates; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Plants; RNA, Plant; Signal Transduction; Soil; Transcription Factors","Herrera-Estrella, L.; Laboratorio Nacional de Genómica para la Biodiversidad, Libramiento Norte Carretera Irapuato-León, C.P. 36821, Irapuato, GTO, Mexico; email: lherrera@ira.cinvestav.mx",,,2146282,,IJDBE,24166442,English,Int.

A set of three types of solid-removing filters consisting of screened sedimentation; upflow sand as well as plastic bead filtration accomplished the mechanical filtration. Values of critical metabolic wastes like total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) (0.92 ppm) and nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N) (0.22 ppm) were found to be well within the acceptable limits, while other water quality parameters in the culture water were also maintained within the normal range by the filtration system. Removal rates of 3.46 g TAN/m3 per day and 0.77 g NO2-Nm 3 per day, as well as TAN and NO2-N removal efficiencies of 29.37 and 27.3% respectively, were established to be the best for the plastic-roll biofilter medium as compared to PVC-pipe and scrub-pad media. Percent removal of TAN and NO2-N per pass of the biofilter (25.49 and 26.3% respectively) and the specific TAN and NO2-N removal rates (43 and 9.6 mg/m2 per day) of plastic rolls were also found to be superior to the other two biofilter media. Pieces of PVC pipes as biofilter medium is recommended to be used in the biofilters in view of their cheaper cost. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

B., Al-Hassa, Saudi Arabia","Several classical warm blooded animal (poultry, sheep, cows, etc.) methods for dietary nutrients evaluation (digestibility, metabolizablity, and energy budget) are applied to fish, even though fish live in a different environment in addition to being cold blooded animals. These applications have caused significant errors that have made these methods non-additive and meaningless, as is explained in the text. In other words, dietary digestion and absorption could not adequately be measured due to the aquatic environment fish live in. Therefore, net nutrient deposition and/or growth are the only accurate measurement left to evaluate dietary nutrients intake in fish. In order to understand and predict dietary nutrient intake-growth response relationship, several mathematical models; (1) the simple linear equation, (2) the logarithmic equation, and (3) the quadratic equation are generally used. These models however, do not describe a full range of growth and have no biological meaning as explained in the text. On the other hand, a model called the saturation kinetic model. It has biological basis (the law of mass action and the enzyme kinetic) and it describes the full range of growth curve. Additionally, it has four parameters that summarize the growth curve and could also be used in comparing diets or nutrients effect on fish growth and/or net nutrient deposition. The saturation kinetic model is proposed to be adequate for dietary nutrient evaluation for fish. The theoretical derivation of this model is illustrated in the text. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Although ion waste production by f ish cannot satisfy all plant requirements, less is known about the relationship between total feed provided for f ish and the production of milliequivalents (mEq) of different macronutrients for plants, especially for nutrient flow hydroponics used for strawberry production in Spain. That knowledge is essential to consider the amount of macronutrients available in aquaculture systems so that farmers can estimate how much nutrient needs to be supplemented in the waste water from fish, to produce viable plant growth. In the present experiment, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) were grown in a small-scale recirculating system at two different densities while growth and feed consumption were noted every week for five weeks. At the same time points, water samples were taken to measure pH, EC25, HCO3-, Cl-, NH4+, NO2- NO3-, H2PO4-, SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ build up. The total increase in mEq of each ion per kg of feed provided to the fish was highest for NO3-, followed, in decreasing order, by Ca2+, H2PO4-, K+, Mg2+ and SO42-. The total amount of feed required per mEq ranged from 1.61- 13.1 kg for the four most abundant ions (NO3-, Ca2+, H2PO4- and K+) at a density of 2 kg fish m-3, suggesting that it would be rather easy to maintain small populations of fish to reduce the cost of hydroponic solution supplementation for strawberries.",Aquaculture; Nutrients; Recirculating system; Tilapia; Water quality,Fragaria x ananassa; Oreochromis niloticus; Tilapia,"Villarroel, M.; Departamento de Producción Animal, Ciudad Universitaria, s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain; email: morrisvillarroel@upmes",,Ministerio de Agricultura Pesca y Alimentacion,1695971X,,,,English; Spanish,Span.

The intensive winter season cultivation of vegetable crops causes more sensitive and hence disease-prone plants. This leads to an intensified application of pesticides, increasing chemical residue risks. Vegetable crops are facing the banning of fumigant methyl bromide application for ground disinfections. Furthermore, chain quality production has become crucial in terms of food safety and environmental impact. Thus, protected cultivation is increasingly shifting from Traditional Culture System (TCS) - in soil - to Soilless Culture System (SCS). The SCS allows to control growth factors and to obtain clean raw material at harvest improving its safety and quality. Among the SCSs, Ebb-and-Flow (EF) and Floating (FL) Systems are relatively cheap and easy- to-use hydroponic systems. They are suitable to produce vegetables both with a short cultural cycle and with a high plant density, and can be considered as an efficient system to produce leafy vegetables, either baby leaves or baby bushes. Controlling the nutrient solution and managing plant growth according to environmental conditions allow decreasing nitrate content in the edible product. Nitrate accumulation, however, is very variable among species. The full control of the inputs that SCS provides should reduce the environmental impact and contribute to product quality standardizati-on.

The system consisted of a 10 m3 gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) tank coupled to aerobic and anaerobic water treatment elements. Nutrients and alkalinity were measured in the system to quantify the main biogeochemical processes. Fractions of the carbon fed in feed were found in fish (18.3%) and in sludge (11%); the missing carbon was respired by fish (45%) and by aerobic (8.4%) and anaerobic (7.7%) microorganisms. Fractions of the nitrogen fed in feed were found in fish (15.4%) and in sludge (14.3%); the missing nitrogen was eliminated by nitrification-denitrification. Most of the phosphorus and ash fed in feed and not found in fish accumulated within the sludge in the system. The rates of nitrification, denitrification and sulphate reduction increased with time, reaching 0.3 g N m- 2 d- 1, 53 g N m- 2 d- 1 and 145 g S m- 2 d- 1, respectively. Nitrification developed more rapidly than denitrification, leading at first to nitrate accumulation (to 20 mmol NO3 l- 1 by day 200) and a decrease in alkalinity. Once denitrification surpassed nitrification, nitrate concentrations decreased, eventually being reduced to &lt; 0.3 mmol NO3 l- 1 by day 510, and alkalinity stabilized. Toxic hydrogen sulphide, generated within the anaerobic sludge, was oxidized by oxygen and nitrate as it diffused through the anaerobic-aerobic sediment-water interface. When nitrate levels in the water above the sludge dropped below 2 mmol l- 1, sulphide was also oxidized in the fluidized bed reactor. Denitrification reduced nitrate in the water, respired (jointly with sulphate reduction) carbon in the sludge, oxidized the hydrogen sulphide, and contributed to stabilization of alkalinity and accumulation of polyphosphate in bacteria as a major sink of labile P. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, phosphorus, nitrate and sulfate cycling in the anaerobic loop of a zero-discharge, recirculating mariculture system was investigated using detailed geochemical measurements in the sludge layer of the digestion basin. High concentrations of nitrate and sulfate, circulating in the overlying water (~15mM), were removed by microbial respiration in the sludge resulting in a sulfide accumulation of up to 3mM. Modelling of the observed S and O isotopic ratios in the surface sludge suggested that, with time, major respiration processes shifted from heterotrophic nitrate and sulfate reduction to autotrophic nitrate reduction. The much higher inorganic P content of the sludge relative to the fish feces is attributed to conversion of organic P to authigenic apatite. This conclusion is supported by: (a) X-ray diffraction analyses, which pointed to an accumulation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase that was different from P phases found in the feces, (b) the calculation that the pore waters of the sludge were highly oversaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite (saturation index=4.87) and (c) there was a decrease in phosphate (and in the Ca/Na molar ratio) in the pore waters simultaneous with an increase in ammonia showing there had to be an additional P removal process at the same time as the heterotrophic breakdown of organic matter. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Anaerobic sludge; Apatite formation; Aquaculture; Denitrification; Phosphorus removal; Sulfur cycling,"Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Apatite; Aquaculture; Calcium phosphate; Denitrification; Hydroxyapatite; Marine biology; Molar ratio; Nitrates; Nitrogen removal; Sulfur compounds; Water; Water treatment; X ray diffraction analysis; Anaerobic sludge; Apatite formation; Geochemical measurements; Microbial respiration; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Phosphorus removal; Sulfur cycling; Water treatment systems; Sludge digestion; ammonia; apatite; calcium; calcium phosphate; hydroxyapatite; nitrate; organic matter; phosphate; phosphorus; sodium; stable isotope; sulfate; sulfide; water; nitric acid derivative; phosphorus; sulfate; waste water; water pollutant; anoxic conditions; bacterium; biofiltration; denitrification; feces; mariculture; nitrate; phosphorus; pollutant removal; recirculating system; respiration; sludge; sulfate; sulfur cycle; water treatment; article; autotrophy; geochemical analysis; heterotrophy; mariculture; microbial respiration; priority journal; reduction; sludge; species differentiation; waste; waste component removal; water treatment; X ray diffraction; zero discharge system; aquaculture; Bacteria; bioreactor; chemistry; metabolism; procedures; waste water; water management; water pollutant; Aquaculture; Bacteria; Bioreactors; Nitrates; Phosphorus; Sulfates; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification","Van Rijn, J.; The Robert H.

The waste products from the fish are converted by a bio-filter into soluble nutrients, which are absorbed by the plants, and allow ""clean"" water to be returned back to the fish. Thus, it produces valuable fish protein with a minimal pollution of fresh water resources, while at the same time producing horticultural (usually vegetable) crops. The production of fertilizers is becoming increasingly expensive due to high prices on fossil fuels, and this may have long term implications for nutrient use in agriculture in the future. Aquaponics uses waste products derived from animals and plants which are fed to the fish, and thus converted into valuable animal protein and fresh vegetables. With the world's fresh water resources limited, aquaponics would appear to have considerable potential for arid and similar climates.

This study focused on revealing the biological nature of the suppression against Fusarium wilt disease, which is caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, and describing the factors that may influence the fungal pathogen in the MPM system. We demonstrated that the rhizosphere microbiota that developed in the MPM system could suppress Fusarium wilt disease under in vitro and greenhouse conditions. The microbiological characteristics of the MPM system were able to control the population dynamics of F. oxysporum, but did not eradicate the fungal pathogen. The roles of the microbiological agents underlying the disease suppression and the magnitude of the disease suppression in the MPM system appear to depend on the microbial density. F. oxysporum that survived in the MPM system formed chlamydospores when exposed to the rhizosphere microbiota. These results suggest that the microbiota suppresses proliferation of F. oxysporum by controlling the pathogen's morphogenesis and by developing an ecosystem that permits coexistence with F. oxysporum. The rhizosphere microbial community in a hydroponics system with multiple parallel mineralization (MPM) can potentially suppress root-borne diseases.

Using system requirements for hydroponic systems and aquaculture, the aquaponic system was compared to a typical Dutch rockwool system. Aquaponics was found to be an improvement on current practices when using Deep Flow Technique (cultivation in a flowing thick water layer), resulting in better nutrient availability for the plants and re-use of nitrate. However, the technical challenges of the direct linkage between the two production systems in terms of needed technology and disease management was found to make the total system suboptimal when compared to conventional practices. The technological advantages of efficiency in use of land and energy and re-use of nutrients were found to be a marginal cost reduction of 1.2%. The article concludes that the added value of aquaponics can be found in the total business concept of producing in an urban environment with direct relationship with consumers.

These macrophytes represent several families of which major ones are Amaranthaceae, Araceae, Azollaceae, Cabombaceae, Ceratophyllaceae, Characeae, Convolvulaceae, Haloragaceae, Hydrocharitaceae, Lemnaceae, Lentibuliaraceae, Menyanthaceae, Najadaceae, Nymphaeaceae, Polygonaceae, Pontederiaceae, Potamogetonaceae, Salvinaceae, Trapaceae, and Typhaceae. In tropical and sub-tropical countries, there are about 40 numbers of fish species belonging to two major families viz., Cyprinidae and Chichlidae, which directly feed on macrophytes. Importantly, these macrophytes may be used as fish food components and replace costly commercial feed owing to their potential nutrients profile: moisture ranges between 84.1-95.9%, dry matter 4.1-15.9%, crude protein 8.7-26.8%, crude fat 2.2-5.1%, carbohydrate 9.3-35.6%, ash 8.0-25.3%, and crude fibre 15.0-28.1%, with caloric content of 2.47-4.2 kcal g-1. For this substantial nutrients status, they are blended with feedstuffs and fed to fish. Consequently, herbivores have shown satisfactory growth in respect of food intake, feed conversion ratio and relative growth rate. About 50% of plant protein has been converted to fish protein and even 30% inclusion of macrophytes into prepared feeds has shown better balance of amino acid. With tremendous potentiality as fish food components, utilisation of macrophytes in preparation of fish feed is an opportunity of livelihood to rural people; since aquaculture is one of the fastest growing sectors in agriculture.",Aquatic macrophytes; Diversity; Food and feed components; Herbivorous fishes,Amaranthaceae; Araceae; Azollaceae; Cabombaceae; Ceratophyllaceae; Characeae; Charales; Convolvulaceae; Cyprinidae; Cypriniformes; Haloragaceae; Hydrocharitaceae; Magnoliophyta; Menyanthaceae; Nymphaeaceae; Pisces; Polygonaceae; Pontederiaceae; Potamogetonaceae; Trapaceae; Typhaceae,"Mandal, R.

Organic and biological agents based on humic and lactic acids were added to the nutrient solution. They were expected to improve the resistance of tomato plants particularly under stress conditions. Stress factors were chosen that are of major concern in hydroponic systems: suboptimal pH values and suboptimal electric conductivity (EC). Humic acid was applied in the form of sodium humate, and lactic acid was applied as lactate (LACTOFOL). The latter has been designed as a suspension leaf fertilizer based on waste material from the dairy industry. Tomato test plants were cultivated in perlite substrate mostly until they had eleven or twelve leaves, and in one of the experiments they were investigated until they produced fruit. The following general conclusions have been drawn: • Humic acid and LACTOFOL produced specific effects at different pH and EC values. • Depending in their concentration and frequency of application, organic agents may either stimulate or inhibit plant growth. • Humic acid improved plant growth when the EC was very high. • When humic acid had been applied by watering the substrate, shoot and root dry matter as well as root length were higher with optimal pH (5.8). • In almost all experiments with pH between 4.5 and 7.5 better growth parameters were recorded when LACTOFOL had been added to the solution. • LACTOFOL was particularly effective in high-pH solutions. • In some cases the development of tomato plants was also enhanced by combinations of humic acid, LACTOFOL and/or Bacillus subtilis.",Bacillus subtilis; Greenhouse; Humic acid; Hydroponics; Lactate; Lycopersicon esculentum L.; Suboptimal pH and EC values; Tomato,Bacillus subtilis; Lycopersicon esculentum,"Michael, B.; Department of Horticultural Science, Lentzeallee 75, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",,,5677572,,,,English,Acta Hortic.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17444403052

A pair of experimental greenhouses was developed at SVSU by a multidisciplinary team of faculty, staff, and students in 2003. The project seeks to identify a cost-effective, year-round means in producing fruits and vegetables.
