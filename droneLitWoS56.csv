Relative to commercial fisheries, however, accurate quantitative data on recreational fishing is often more challenging to collect. The quality and robustness of recreational fishing surveys to assess fisher numbers may be improved with cost-effective remote sensing platforms, such as aerial drones. Here, the precision and cost-effectiveness of drone-based surveys were compared with more traditional vessel-based surveys of recreational fishing participation at four locations on the east coast of Australia. Although vessel-based surveys had greater initial costs, this technique observed more fishers, took less time to complete and did not require post-processing of video footage. In comparison, the drone-based video surveys provided greater precision and a permanent record of fishing activity. Currently, drone-based techniques do not provide a substantial improvement to traditional vessel-based counts of fishers. The complimentary use of drones appears to be an appropriate application of this technology for supporting fisheries management.","[Provost, Euan J.; Kelaher, Brendan P.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, 2 Bay Dr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Provost, Euan J.; Kelaher, Brendan P.] Southern Cross Univ, Marine Ecol Res Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Butcher, Paul A.; Coleman, Melinda A.] Natl Marine Sci Ctr, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia",Southern Cross University; Southern Cross University; Southern Cross University; NSW Department of Primary Industries,"Provost, EJ (corresponding author), Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, 2 Bay Dr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia.;Provost, EJ (corresponding author), Marine Ecol Res Ctr, 2 Bay Dr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia.",euanjprovost@gmail.com,"Butcher, Paul/T-4367-2019; Kelaher, Brendan/P-3647-2017","Butcher, Paul/0000-0001-7338-6037; Kelaher, Brendan/0000-0002-7505-4412; Provost, Euan/0000-0001-8128-9560",Southern Cross University; ARC LIEF [LE170100007]; SCU; Commonwealth Government,Southern Cross University; ARC LIEF(Australian Research Council); SCU; Commonwealth Government,"The project was administered and funded by Southern Cross University and funding for drone equipment provided through an ARC LIEF Grant (LE170100007) for BPK, PAB and MAC.

Management agencies typically use on-ground surveillance to monitor and minimise illegal fishing practices, the efficacy of which may be enhanced by integrating emerging remote sensing technology. Affordable drones may contribute to cost-effective detection of illegal fishing activity and associated gear, although their application has yet to be evaluated in many types of fisheries. Here, the utility of drones for the detection of crab traps and floats set in a shallow estuary was quantitatively tested, and the effects of survey altitudes, cameras and monitor screens on detection rates were determined. It was found that drone flight altitude and float colour influenced the detection rates of common crab trap floats, with infrared cameras improving the detection of floats camouflaged by black paint. However, the type of monitor screen used by the drone operator had no influence on the detection of crab traps. Overall, it appears drones can contribute to cost-effective compliance in estuarine trap fisheries, and the approach can contribute to evidence-based standard operating procedures.","[Provost, Euan J.; Butcher, Paul A.; Coleman, Melinda A.; Bloom, Daniel; Kelaher, Brendan P.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Provost, Euan J.; Butcher, Paul A.; Coleman, Melinda A.; Bloom, Daniel; Kelaher, Brendan P.] Southern Cross Univ, Marine Ecol Res Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Butcher, Paul A.; Coleman, Melinda A.] New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia",Southern Cross University; Southern Cross University; Southern Cross University; NSW Department of Primary Industries,"Provost, EJ (corresponding author), Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia.;Provost, EJ (corresponding author), Southern Cross Univ, Marine Ecol Res Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia.",euanjprovost@gmail.com,"Butcher, Paul/T-4367-2019; Provost, Euan/AAQ-9241-2020; Kelaher, Brendan/P-3647-2017","Butcher, Paul/0000-0001-7338-6037; Provost, Euan/0000-0001-8128-9560; Kelaher, Brendan/0000-0002-7505-4412",,,,,45,11,12,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0969-997X,1365-2400,,FISHERIES MANAG ECOL,Fisheries Manag.

Estuarine crab trapping is likely subject to high levels of illegal and potential ghost fishing, because it also has good economic incentives regarding potential catch, low gear acquisition costs and accessible fishing grounds. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance operations, the efficacy of small consumer-grade drones for sighting traps in an estuary in NSW, Australia, was tested. Twelve sets of two flights were undertaken at 20 and 30 m altitude over a 600-m stretch of estuary for 5 days to quantify the detectability of submerged mesh traps of three different mesh colours. The drone was able to detect the majority of traps efficiently, with depth in relation to water clarity being the main factor affecting detection. In shallow water, detection rates were high for all mesh colours, but in the slightly deeper placements, orange traps were more readily detected. This study demonstrates that drones could be an efficient and reliable tool for rapidly assessing areas for illegal and derelict traps and can be supplemented into land or vessel-based fisheries operations.","[Bloom, Daniel; Butcher, Paul A.; Colefax, Andrew P.; Provost, Euan J.; Kelaher, Brendan P.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Butcher, Paul A.] Natl Marine Sci Ctr, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Cullis, Brian R.] Univ Wollongong, Fac Engn & Informat Sci, Natl Inst Appl Stat Res Australia, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",Southern Cross University; NSW Department of Primary Industries; Southern Cross University; University of Wollongong,"Butcher, PA (corresponding author), Natl Marine Sci Ctr, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia.",paul.butcher@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Butcher, Paul/T-4367-2019; Provost, Euan/AAQ-9241-2020; cullis, brian r/E-7078-2010; Kelaher, Brendan/P-3647-2017","Butcher, Paul/0000-0001-7338-6037; Provost, Euan/0000-0001-8128-9560; Kelaher, Brendan/0000-0002-7505-4412; Cullis, Brian/0000-0001-6319-8155; Colefax, Andrew/0000-0003-4720-0256",,,,,56,18,18,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0969-997X,1365-2400,,FISHERIES MANAG ECOL,Fisheries Manag.

Results indicated a 357% spike in interest during 2016 primarily in New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. From an ecological perspective, many species targeted by drone fishers are vulnerable to overexploitation, while released fishes may experience heightened stress and mortality. From a social perspective, the ethics of drone fishing are being increasingly questioned by many recreational anglers and we forecast the potential for increased conflict with other beach users. In terms of governance, no resource use legislation specifically directed at recreational drone fishing was found.

Distance from shore, coupled with the highly mobile nature of fish stocks, has put attention on new monitoring, control and surveillance technologies to collect spatially referenced data on the location of fishing vessels, gears and even fish stocks and eradicate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity. Faced with their nascent implementation, research is yet to address how these technologies are reconfiguring the roles and responsibilities of public and private actors involved in fisheries management, including who collects and controls fisheries related information. In this paper, we compare three monitoring, control and surveillance technologies that are gaining traction in fisheries; the use of private fish attraction devices in oceanic tuna fisheries, unmanned public drones for marine surveillance and global satellite monitoring of fishing vessels. In doing so, we question how different configurations of actors are structuring flows of information and with what effect on sustainability performance of high seas fisheries. We also explore how these technologies configure new (and imagined) geographies of high seas fisheries which challenge existing modes of fisheries management.","[Toonen, Hilde M.; Bush, Simon R.] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Toonen, Hilde M.] Wageningen Univ, CONTACT,Hilde M,Toonen,Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Toonen, HM (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.;Toonen, HM (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, CONTACT,Hilde M,Toonen,Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",hilde.toonen@wur.nl,,,,,,,83,50,51,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-908X,1522-7200,,J ENVIRON POL PLAN,J.

The boom-and-bust nature of many jellyfish populations means that biomass estimates used in monitoring need to be rapid and accurate, and assessing the temporal and spatial variability of jellyfish populations can also help determine their ecological role. Here we used off-the-shelf drone technology coupled with automated image processing to show that densities, size measurements and biomass estimates of an edible jellyfish, the Jelly Blubber Catostylus mosaicus, can be rapidly estimated over much larger areas than traditional field sampling and without requiring fishing effort. Estimated biomass within Smiths Lake, New South Wales, Australia was roughly 350 kg per hectare, and size frequency distributions were skewed towards larger specimens compared to previous studies in other locations.

The aerial drone flies automatically to the destination area conveying the underwater drone, and after it alights on the water, the underwater drone starts to cruise. Its mobile network communication realizes automatic flight, remote control, and real-time transmission of video signals of both drones. After the underwater drone completes its mission, it is collected by the aerial drone again and the aerial drone flies back to the base station automatically. Remote control of the underwater drone is realized utilizing its location information, provided by our acoustic positioning system that is indispensable under the sea where GPS cannot be used. This paper describes the details of this acoustic positioning system of our combined aerial and underwater drones. It is based on SSBL, and uses a pinger instead of a transponder to keep costs down. In addition, a relatively short chirp pulse is generated in order to improve resistance to reflection. Future work will include improvement of the accuracy and stability of acoustic positioning in order to realize the automatic cruise of the underwater drone as well as the aerial drone, as the underwater drone is currently operated manually.","[Kawada, Ryoichi; Nishitani, Akihiko; Kojima, Junichi] KDDI Res Inc, Tokyo, Japan","KDDI Corporation; KDDI Research, Inc.","Kawada, R (corresponding author), KDDI Res Inc, Tokyo, Japan.",ry-kawada@kddi.com; ak-nishitani@kddi.com; kojima@kddi-research.jp,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0197-7385,,978-1-6654-6809-1,OCEANS-IEEE,,,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/OCEANS47191.2022.9977099,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS47191.2022.9977099,,,5,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Oceanography,BU6IQ,,,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000925311400147,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their ecological impacts could be substantial given their high abundance in some reef locations and thus monitoring their populations and spatial distribution is of research interest. Traditional in situ surveys are laborious and only cover small areas but drones offer an opportunity to scale observations more broadly, especially if the holothurians can be automatically detected in drone imagery using deep learning algorithms. We adapted the object detection algorithm YOLOv3 to detect holothurians from drone imagery at Hideaway Bay, Queensland, Australia. We successfully detected 11,462 of 12,956 individuals over 2.7ha with an average density of 0.5 individual/m(2). We tested a range of hyperparameters to determine the optimal detector performance and achieved 0.855 mAP, 0.82 precision, 0.83 recall, and 0.82 F1 score. We found as few as ten labelled drone images was sufficient to train an acceptable detection model (0.799 mAP). Our results illustrate the potential of using small, affordable drones with direct implementation of open-source object detection models to survey holothurians and other shallow water sessile species.","[Li, Joan Y.

However, direct georeferencing of fishing activities using aerial drones is a versatile and easy option that can potentially improve fishery studies, especially in Marine Protected Areas. We investigated the utility of aerial images to understand spatial displacement and fishing territoriality in a Brazilian MPA system under risk of deregulation. Survey flights were conducted in the multiple use area where fishing is allowed in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, located in the South Atlantic Ocean and considered one of the main ecotourism destinations and marine conservation sites in Brazil. An aircraft was used to map and detect several aspects of fishing activities and shallow seabed characteristics to demonstrate its utility for fishery management. We recorded 89 fishing activities in the marine area and 75 shore fishers on beaches. Results documented areas most intensively targeted by fishers, and operational aspects of fishing effort, both onboard and shoreline activities targeting shoals. Enforcement and monitoring efforts must be strengthened to assess the impact of expanded fishing activity in this marine sanctuary, mainly due to fading conservation rules imposed by top-down political decisions. This aerial approach demonstrates the utility of quantifying and mapping fishing activities to assist both MPA and fisheries management aligned to benchmarks for biodiversity conservation and human-based demands.","[Reis-Filho, Jose Amorim] Univ Fed Bahia, Programa Pos Grad Ecol Aplicada Gestao Ambiental, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Reis-Filho, Jose Amorim] ICHTUS Ambiente & Soc, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Joyeux, Jean-Christophe; Pimentel, Caio Ribeiro; Teixeira, Joao Batista; Macieira, Raphael] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Dept Oceanog & Ecol, Vitoria, ES, Brazil; [Garla, Ricardo C.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Bot & Zool, Natal, RN, Brazil; [Mello, Thayna] Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao & Biodiversidade IC, Sao Sebastiao, Brazil; [Gasparini, Joao Luiz] Univ Fed Rio De Janeiro, Inst Biodiversidade Sustentabilidade, Macae, Brazil; [Giarrizzo, Tommaso] Univ Fed Para, Nucleo Ecol Aquat & Pesca Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Rocha, Luiz; Pinheiro, Hudson T.] Calif Acad Sci, Dept Ichthyol, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Pinheiro, Hudson T.] Univ Sao Paulo, Ctr Marine Biol, Sao Sebastiao, Brazil; [Pinheiro, Hudson T.] Assoc Ambiental Voz Nat, Vitoria, ES, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia; Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Para; California Academy of Sciences; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Reis, JA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Programa Pos Grad Ecol Aplicada Gestao Ambiental, ICHTUS UFBA, BR-40170110 Salvador, BA, Brazil.",amorim@ichtusambiental.com.br,"Giarrizzo, Tommaso/G-8482-2016; Pinheiro, Hudson Tercio/A-4065-2019; Macieira, Raphael/G-2808-2011","Giarrizzo, Tommaso/0000-0002-5116-5206; Pinheiro, Hudson Tercio/0000-0002-3143-1474; Macieira, Raphael/0000-0002-8871-8724; Gasparini, Joao Luiz/0000-0001-8294-0618",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo; Fundacao Estadual de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Espirito Santo; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior; Fundacao Grupo Boticario de Protecao a Natureza,Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Fundacao Estadual de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Espirito Santo; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao Grupo Boticario de Protecao a Natureza,Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo; Fundacao Estadual de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Espirito Santo; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior; Fundacao Grupo Boticario de Protecao a Natureza,,40,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0969-997X,1365-2400,,FISHERIES MANAG ECOL,Fisheries Manag.

Although, historically, these assemblages have proven difficult to quantify, we used a new drone-based approach to assess spatial and temporal variation in assemblages of large marine fauna off four exposed beaches in New South Wales, Australia. In total, 4388 individual large marine animals were identified from 216 drone flights. The most common taxa, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) and Australian cownose rays (Rhinoptera neglecta), occurred in 25.5 and 19.9% of flights respectively. White (Carcharodon carcharias), bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and other whaler (Carcharhinus spp.) sharks were observed in <1% of flights. There was significant variation in the structure of assemblages of large fauna among beaches, with those adjacent to riverine estuaries having greater richness and abundance of wildlife. Overall, drone surveys were successful in documenting the spatio-temporal dynamics of an impressive suite of large marine fauna.

The bathymetric difference between our DEM and the LiDAR dataset is -0.016 +/- 0.45 m (1 sigma). Our results show that it is possible, in conditions of calm waters, low winds and minimal sun glint, to deploy consumer-grade drones as a relatively low-cost and rapid survey technique to produce multispectral and bathymetric data on shallow-water coral reefs.

For example, derelict oyster farming rafts along the southwestern coast of Taiwan have been a source of marine debris pollution since the 1980s. An efficient inspection system is an urgent requirement for monitoring oyster farming areas and, is expected to implement control and surveillance measures for litter discarded from coastal fisheries. To address this issue, this study examined combinations of radio frequency identification (RFID), drone archiving, and onshore receiving systems to ascertain the positions of oyster rafts and their owners with digitally tagged labels. The results showed that the two proposed monitoring systems are feasible for use in marine environments. The RFID signals archived by the drone reached 100% of the 200 tags with a spatial bias ranging from 2.38 to 59.99 m. RFID-GPS hybrid tag signals received by the onshore station covered 100% of the 20 tags with spatial bias ranging from 1.27 to 10.47 m. The RFID-GPS hybrid system was confirmed as a feasible approach for monitoring oyster rafts within 3 km of the coast.

New innovations include autonomous underwater vehicles carrying cameras along with miniaturized sensors, aerial drones, computer simulation of fishing gear geometry, environmental DNA assays, computer visualizations and deep learning. The successful application of such tools and methods promises to improve our understanding of factors that influence capture, escape and stress of caught species.

As recent technological developments have improved the versatility and functionality of UAVs, the potential of these systems for research on small-scale and artisanal fisheries has grown considerably, although this potential is still underexploited. However, there is growing interest in the application of cost-effective UAVs for aerial surveys of fishery activities, but few empirical studies have produced reliable findings to aid the development of effective management actions. Common challenges for effective management include funding limitations and problems related to survey design, coverage, and implementation. In this context, aerial devices have the capacity to fill a niche for intensive fine-scale sampling in which data gathering strategies need to be tailored to specific operational requirements. Detailed documentation and monitoring of harvest processes and fisheries practices by UAVs can provide important insights into fishing gear and techniques (e.g., gillnets and seine nets), the operation of stationary artisanal fishing devices (e.g., traps and tidal fishing weirs), area coverage, fishery territories, and the number of fishers and/or fleet size. Here, we present and discuss the potential use of UAVs for surveying small-scale fishing activities as a complement to traditional research methods (e.g., fishery-dependent approaches, such as landing monitoring, electronic logbooks, dealer reports, dockside intercepts, and fishery cruises). We predict that the use of UAV as a fishery survey tool will become increasingly widespread as the technology and associated methods are refined and become more affordable with potential to generate significant advances in fishery management practices.","[Reis-Filho, Jose Amorim] ICHTUS Solucoes Meio Ambiente, BR-41904250 Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Reis-Filho, Jose Amorim; Giarrizzo, Tommaso] Univ Fed Para, Nucleo Ecol Aquat & Pesca Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Reis-Filho, Jose Amorim] Programa Pos Grad Ecol Aplicada Gestao Ambiental, Salvador, BA, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Para,"Reis, JA (corresponding author), ICHTUS Solucoes Meio Ambiente, BR-41904250 Salvador, BA, Brazil.;Reis, JA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Para, Nucleo Ecol Aquat & Pesca Amazonia, Belem, Para, Brazil.;Reis, JA (corresponding author), Programa Pos Grad Ecol Aplicada Gestao Ambiental, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",amorim@ichtusambiental.com.br,"Giarrizzo, Tommaso/G-8482-2016","Giarrizzo, Tommaso/0000-0002-5116-5206",ICHTUS,ICHTUS,"This work was supported through a financial support from ICHTUS solucoes em meio ambiente.

In total, 5979 R. neglecta were observed with overall relative abundance (+/- SE) of, 20.4 (+/- 3.3) individuals per transect. The numbers of R. neglecta varied among locations, with the highest density found off the beach adjacent to the river mouth at Evans Head. The number of rays observed also decreased with increasing wind speed. While some of this relationship was probably associated with visibility, R. neglecta may also move offshore during strong winds. We found no evidence that R. neglecta was under significant threat.

Yet, technoscience is offering new tools that have the potential to reimagine how inland fisheries are assessed and managed. So-called technosciencerefers to instances in which science and technology unfurl together, offering novel ways of spurring and achieving meaningful change. This paper considers the role of technoscience and its potential for modernizing the assessment and management of inland fisheries. It first explores technoscience and its potential benefits, followed by presentation of a series of synopses that explore the application (both successes and challenges) of new technologies such as environmental DNA (eDNA), genomics, electronic tags, drones, phone apps, iEcology, and artificial intelligence to assessment and management. The paper also considers the challenges and barriers that exist in adopting new technologies. The paper concludes with a provocative assessment of the potential of technoscience to reform and modernize inland fisheries assessment and management. Although these tools are increasingly being embraced, there is a lack of platforms for aggregating these data streams and providing managers with actionable information in a timely manner.The ideas presented here should serve as a catalyst for beginning to work collectively and collaboratively towards fisheries assessment and management systems that harness the power of technology and serve to modernize inland fisheries management. Such transformation is urgently needed given the dynamic nature of environmental change, the evolving threat matrix facing inland waters, and the complex behavior of fishers. Quite simply, a dynamic world demands dynamic fisheries management; technoscience has made that within reach. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

This affects availability to capture, the spatial scale of needed governance, and our food supply. Technological advances make it possible to track marine fish (and fishermen) in ways not previously possible and tracking data is expected to grow exponentially over the next ten years - the bio-logging decade. In this article, we identify fisheries management data needs that tracking data can help fill, ranging from: improved estimates of natural mortality and abundance to providing the basis for short-term fisheries closures (i.e. dynamic closures) and conservation of biodiversity hotspots and migratory corridors. However, the sheer size of the oceans, lack of GPS capability, and aspects of marine fish life history traits (e.g., adult/offspring size ratios, high mortality rates) create challenges to obtaining this data. We address these challenges and forecast how they will be met in the next 10 years through increased use of drones and sensor networks, decreasing tag size with increased sensor capacity trends, the ICARUS initiative to increase satellite tracking capacity, and improved connectivity between marine and terrestrial movement researchers and databases.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, 7922 NW 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Kays, Roland] North Carolina Museum Nat Sci, 11 West Jones St, Raleigh, NC USA; [Kays, Roland] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, 2820 Faucette Dr,Campus Box 8001, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [Thorson, James T.] NOAA, Fisheries Resource Assessment & Monitoring Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Wikelski, Martin] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Migrat & Immunoecol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Wikelski, Martin] Konstanz Univ, Dept Biol, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Thorson, James T.] NOAA, Habitat & Ecosyst Proc Res Program, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; North Carolina State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Max Planck Society; University of Konstanz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Lowerre-Barbieri, SK (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, 7922 NW 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA.;Lowerre-Barbieri, SK (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",Susan.Barbieri@myfwc.com,"Lowerre-Barbieri, Sue/JOZ-3798-2023; Thorson, James T/H-8771-2019; Thorson, James T/O-7937-2014","Lowerre-Barbieri, Sue/0000-0001-5146-3257; Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Thorson, James T/0000-0001-7415-1010; Kays, Roland/0000-0002-2947-6665",,,,,129,53,53,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

Conventional counting methods, however, can be inaccurate and time-consuming. Here we present two novel methods to monitor recreational fishing applied in Kaunas water reservoir (ca 65 km(2)), Lithuania, comparing their performance to a conventional visual count. First, we employed a remotely piloted fixed wing drone which conducted 39 missions distributed over one year and compared its accuracy to conventional visual land or boat-based counts. With these data we developed a linear model to predict the annual number of anglers depending on weekday and ice conditions. Second, we used anonymous data from a popular GPS-enabled sonar device Deeper (R) , used by anglers to explore underwater landscapes and to find fish. The sonar usage probability was calibrated with angler observations from drones using Bayesian methods, demonstrating that at any given time ~2 % of anglers are using the sonar device during the open water season and ~15 % during the ice fishing season. The calibrated values were then used to estimate the total number of anglers, given the daily records of sonar usage in Kaunas water reservoir. The predicted annual number of anglers from both linear drone-based and Bayesian sonar-based methods gave similar results of 25 and 27 thousand anglers within the area during the period of day surveyed, which corresponded to nearly 110 thousand angling trips in the total reservoir area annually. Our study shows high potential of both drone and fish finder digital devices for assessing recreational fishing activities through space and time.","[Dainys, Justas; Gorfine, Harry; Mateos-Gonzalez, Fernando; Audzijonyte, Asta] Nat Res Ctr, Akademijos Str 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Gorfine, Harry] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Melbourne, Australia; [Mateos-Gonzalez, Fernando] ALKA Wildlife Ops, Pec, Czech Republic; [Skov, Christian] Tech Univ Denmark, Sect Freshwater Fisheries & Ecol, Lyngby, Denmark; [Urbanavic, Robertas] Aerodiagnostika JSC, Lithuanian Republ, Trakai, Lithuania",Nature Research Center - Lithuania; University of Melbourne; Technical University of Denmark,"Dainys, J (corresponding author), Nat Res Ctr, Akademijos Str 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania.",justas.dainys@gamtc.lt,"Gorfine, Harry/GOE-3967-2022; Skov, Christian/X-6511-2019","Gorfine, Harry/0000-0001-6933-3389; Skov, Christian/0000-0002-8547-6520; Urbanavicius, Robertas/0009-0008-9380-6738; Mateos-Gonzalez, Fernando/0000-0001-6765-8761","European Regional Development Fund, Lithuania under grant agreement with the Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT) [01.2.2-LMT-K-718-02-0006]; European Commission; Danish Rod and Net Fish License Funds [39122]; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark","European Regional Development Fund, Lithuania under grant agreement with the Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Danish Rod and Net Fish License Funds; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF); Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark","We thank Augustas Morkvenas for help with boat-based angler counts, Tobias Andermann and Daniele Silvestro for help with Bayesian analyses.

Developing drone technology and traditional over-flights by aerial surveillance may supplement satellite technology with 'eyewitness' evidence. Well-crafted regulations will be able to make some use of this data, but the evidential requirements of criminal courts make prosecutions difficult to pursue. There is some scope to expand management opportunities through vesting the fishery in a public body and pursuing offenders through civil law, this approach having a different suite of remedies. Other opportunities lie in giving very large marine protected areas legal personality which has similar advantages and additional reputational benefits. Using remote sensing data in the civil court poses evidential problems. An alternative approach is to collate data around frequent infringers and, by negatively impacting on their reputation, restrict their ability to obtain insurance, finance, access to fisheries and market access. This is exemplified in port state measures by fisheries authorities and chain of custody requirements by labelling bodies. Data sharing raises challenges with intellectual property and coordination. The paper demonstrates that there are opportunities to make VLMPAs work more effectively.","[Appleby, Thomas; Moorhouse, Brendon; Staddon, Chad; Bean, Emma] Univ West England, Int Water Secur Network, Frenchay Campus,Coldhardbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Studley, Matthew] Univ West England, Engn Design & Math, Bristol, Avon, England; [Brown, Judith] South Atlantic Res Inst, Stanley, Falkland Island",University of West England; University of West England,"Appleby, T (corresponding author), Univ West England, Int Water Secur Network, Frenchay Campus,Coldhardbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",,"Studley, Matt/AAT-3023-2021","Studley, Matt/0000-0001-8520-0324",Lloyd's Register Foundation,Lloyd's Register Foundation,"The research is part funded by the Lloyd's Register Foundation, a charitable foundation helping to protect life and property by supporting engineeringrelated education, public engagement and the application of research.",,51,4,4,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Remotely piloted vehicles or drones (RPVs) could provide a complementary method but need verification due to a host of methodological differences. To compare methods, we counted summer Chinook redds (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) (similar to 6 m(2) in size) using RPVs and compared them to ground-based counts in the Wenatchee River (WA, USA). We found individual aerial counts were many times twice the corresponding ground counts. We also found large inter-observer variability among aerial counters. The coefficient of variation among multiple aerial counts were 37%, 38%, and 50% across three sites, which are comparable to published variation in ground counts. We attribute inter-observer variability to inherent uncertainties in redd identification similar to ground counting, and importantly, we did not see evidence that the clarity of substrate in the image influenced observer bias. Overall, our data suggest that redd counting using RPVs is an effective method, particularly in high-density spawning locations. We conclude that RPV imagery accurately identifies redds in a clear, relatively wide (60 m) river, but suggest continuing research into increasing precision, limiting observer variability, and assessing the accuracy across methods and locations.","[Auerbach, Daniel S.; Fremier, Alexander K.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Auerbach, DS (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",daniel.s.auerbach@wsu.edu,"Fremier, Alexander/AAC-7706-2019","Auerbach, Daniel/0000-0003-3596-2624; Fremier, Alexander/0000-0002-4104-6633",School of the Environment at WSU,School of the Environment at WSU,"Danny Auerbach was funded by a teaching assistantship in the School of the Environment at WSU.

More than half of the very distinctive individuals were seen more than once, and 28.5% were seen in multiple years, with one individual seen 14 times over a 15-year span. Resighted individuals and those in the main cluster of the social network were found in significantly shallower water than individuals that were not resighted or that were in isolated clusters. Distances between resighting locations suggest small home ranges. This suggests an insular slope-dwelling population that overlaps with an offshore population. Evidence of unsuccessful predatory attempts by large sharks was recorded on four individuals, and linear wounds consistent with interactions with line fisheries were documented on three individuals. Surface and subsurface behavior recorded by drone revealed vigilance behavior likely to minimize predation risk.

While the eating of fish is spreading worldwide, the depletion of fishery resources has become a problem owing to overfishing, and the importance of aquaculture is increasing in order to continue to supply fish as food. In marine aquaculture, fish are grown in aquaculture cages in the sea. Thus, if a harmful algal bloom (HAB) reaches the cages, it will cause serious damage. Countermeasures against HAB are one of the important problems for aquaculture fishermen. In Nagasaki Prefecture in Japan, countermeasures against HAB include patrolling and sampling water by ships. These samples are then submitted to HAB experts for analysis. Following this analysis, notification is provided to aquaculture fishermen. When HAB is detected early, aquaculture fishermen can minimize the damage of HAB by stopping feeding and moving the aquaculture cages. In this study, we developed a system of early detection and notification of HAB to aquaculture fishermen. This is carried out by patrolling and sampling water using drones, detection of HAB by microscope and PC operation, and automatic notification by email and web application. As a result of this developed system, the identification accuracy of harmful plankton is more than 90%, and the time taken to find HABs can be shortened from the 6 h of the conventional approach to 15 min using this newly developed system.","[Kimura, Fukuyoshi; Sato, Yasuhiko] Syst Five Co Ltd, 1-9-31 Hayama, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528053, Japan; [Kimura, Fukuyoshi; Morinaga, Akihiro; Yamamoto, Ikuo; Kobayashi, Toru] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Engn, 1-14 Bunkyomachi, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan; [Fukushima, Masayoshi; Ishiguro, Tomonari] KDDI Corp, Chiyoda Ku, 3-10-10 Iidabashi, Tokyo 1028560, Japan; [Sakaguchi, Akihiro; Kawashita, Tomoyuki] Sasebo Coll, Natl Inst Technol, Dept Control Engn, 1-1 Okishinmachi, Sasebo, Nagasaki 8571192, Japan",Nagasaki University; KDDI Corporation,"Kimura, F (corresponding author), Syst Five Co Ltd, 1-9-31 Hayama, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528053, Japan.;Kimura, F (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Engn, 1-14 Bunkyomachi, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan.",f-kimura@sfk-nga.co.jp,,,Project for IoT Services Creation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan; Strategic Information and Communications R&D Promotion Programme (SCOPE) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan,Project for IoT Services Creation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan; Strategic Information and Communications R&D Promotion Programme (SCOPE) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan,"This work was supported by Project for IoT Services Creation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan.

UAS also provide transformative potential to study the ways in which humans interact with and affect marine and coastal ecosystems, but doing so presents unique ethical and legal challenges. Human subjects have property rights that must be respected and they have rights to privacy, as well as expectations of privacy and security that may extend beyond actual legal rights.

Coastal and inland water ecosystems are very complex but crucial due to their richness and primary production. In this context, remote sensing can be a reliable way to monitor these areas, mainly thanks to satellite sensors' improved spatial and spectral capabilities and airborne or drone instruments. In general, mapping bodies of water is challenging due to low signal-to-noise (SNR) at sensor level, due to the very low reflectance of water surfaces as well as atmospheric effects. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to provide a robust processing framework to estimate water quality parameters in inland shallow waters using multiplatform data. More specifically, we measured chlorophyll concentrations (Chl-a) from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors on board satellites, aircrafts and drones. The Natural Reserve of Maspalomas, Canary Island (Spain), was chosen for the study because of its complexity as well as being an inner lagoon with considerable organic and inorganic matter and chlorophyll concentration. This area can also be considered a well-known coastal-dune ecosystem attracting a large amount of tourists. The water quality parameter estimated by the remote sensing platforms has been validated using co-temporal in situ measurements collected during field campaigns, and quite satisfactory results have been achieved for this complex ecosystem. In particular, for the drone hyperspectral instrument, the root mean square error, computed to quantify the differences between the estimated and in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations, was 3.45 with a bias of 2.96.","[Eugenio, Francisco; Marcello, Javier] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, ULPGC, Unidad Asociada ULPGC, Inst Oceanog & Cambio Global,IOCAG,CSIC, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Canary Islands, Spain; [Martin, Javier] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, ULPGC, Dept Fis, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Canary Islands, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Eugenio, F (corresponding author), Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, ULPGC, Unidad Asociada ULPGC, Inst Oceanog & Cambio Global,IOCAG,CSIC, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Canary Islands, Spain.",francisco.eugenio@ulpgc.es; javier.marcello@ulpgc.es; javier.martin@ulpgc.es,"Marcello, Javier/L-2858-2017","Eugenio, Francisco/0000-0002-0010-4024; Marcello, Javier/0000-0002-9646-1017",Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER): project ARTEMISAT-2 [CTM2016-77733-R],Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER): project ARTEMISAT-2,This research was funded by Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) and by the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER): project ARTEMISAT-2 (CTM2016-77733-R).,,35,4,4,0,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,JAN,2020,12,2,,,,,,,284,10.3390/rs12020284,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12020284,,,18,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,KO5DK,,gold,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000515569800083,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite being the larger and more conspicuous bioturbators on coral reefs, the value of holothurians (sea cucumbers) to reef ecosystems is less often attributed to their ecosystem services than their value for fisheries. This may be because they are considered to have an insignificant effect on reef health relative to other animals. Here, we ground-truthed remote sensing data obtained from drone and satellite imagery to estimate the bioturbation rates of holothurians across the 19 km(2) Heron Island Reef in Queensland, Australia. Ex situ bioturbation rates of the most abundant holothurian, Holothuria atra, were assessed during 24-h feeding experiments. Using density measurements of holothurians across reef flat zones in a 27,000 m(2) map produced from drone imagery, we extrapolated bioturbation across the reef using satellite remote sensing data. Individual H. atra were estimated to produce approximately 14 kg of bioturbated sediment per year. On a reef scale (excluding the reef lagoon) and accounting for varying densities of holothurians across different reef zones, total bioturbation from holothurians at Heron Reef was estimated at over 64,000 metric tonnes per year, slightly more than the mass of five Eiffel Towers. These results highlight the scale of structural and biochemical impacts that holothurians have on reef flats and their importance to ecosystem functioning and services. Management of these animals on reefs is imperative as overharvesting would likely cause substantial negative effects on sedimentary ecosystems and their biogeochemistry in corals reefs.","[Williamson, Jane E.; Raoult, Vincent] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Duce, Stephanie] James Cook Univ, TropWATER Coll Sci & Engn, Bebegu Yumba Campus, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Joyce, Karen E.] James Cook Univ, TropWATER Coll Sci & Engn, Nguma Bada Campus, Cairns, Qld 4879, Australia; [Raoult, Vincent] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia",Macquarie University; James Cook University; James Cook University; University of Newcastle,"Williamson, JE (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",jane.williamson@mq.edu.au,"Duce, Stephanie J/C-7969-2017; Joyce, Karen E/A-6794-2013; Raoult, Vincent/H-6038-2019","Duce, Stephanie J/0000-0002-3225-3315; Joyce, Karen E/0000-0003-1269-7362; Raoult, Vincent/0000-0001-9459-111X; Williamson, Jane/0000-0003-3627-4508",Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University; University of Newcastle; Early Career Rising Star Grant from JCU,Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University; University of Newcastle; Early Career Rising Star Grant from JCU,"The authors thank Kristy Brown, Katy Baker and Edith Shum for their assistance with digitizing and Gemma Clifton and Olivia Seeger for assistance in the field.

Acoustic alarms (pingers) have been demonstrated to be an efficient mitigation tool to prevent bycatch of this species; however, little is known about the behavioral reactions of wild porpoises to pingers. This knowledge is important for optimizing the design and use of pingers. We tracked 16 wild porpoises with a drone and recorded their behavior before and during exposure to pinger sounds. Range from the pinger to the porpoise was 158-797 m when the pinger was first activated. In four of the exposures, with pinger-to-porpoise ranges of 199-521 m, reaction to the pinger was strong avoidance behavior with increased swimming speed heading away from the pinger. Average number of surfacings decreased from 3.4 surfacings/min before pinging to 2.8 surfacings/min during pinging. Eight animals were lost from the drone's field of view as soon as the pinger playback started, indicating that they were either diving deep or speeding away from the area very rapidly. Four animals did not respond to pinger sounds, demonstrating a diversity in the behavioral response. Neither the behavior of porpoises (i.e., foraging, socializing and traveling) before sound exposure, the animal's initial direction in relation to the sound source, nor the porpoise-to-pinger range affected their reaction in relation to the pinger. Pingers can cause very strong aversive reactions in harbor porpoises, which explains their efficiency in reducing bycatch. The strong aversive reactions may suggest that pinger use should be limited to critical time periods and regions, or that more focus needs to be put on developing acoustic devices which cause less severe behavioral reactions. At the same time, this study shows that 25 % of animals may not react to pinger sounds, indicating a great diversity in behavioral responses.","[Brennecke, Dennis; Siebert, Ursula] Univ Vet Med Hannover, Inst Terr & Aquat Wildlife Res, Busum, Germany; [Brennecke, Dennis; Ortiz, Sara Torres; Wahlberg, Magnus] Univ Southern Denmark, Marine Biol Res Ctr, Dept Biol, Kerteminde, Denmark; [Kindt-Larsen, Lotte] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Lyngby, Denmark; [Midtiby, Henrik Skov; Egemose, Henrik Dyrberg] Univ Southern Denmark, SDU UAS Ctr, Odense, Denmark; [Ortiz, Sara Torres] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Seewiesen, Germany; [Brennecke, Dennis; Knickmeier, Katrin] Leibniz Inst Sci & Math Educ, Kiel, Germany; [Wahlberg, Magnus] Univ Southern Denmark, Marine Biol Res Ctr, Hindsholmvej 11, DK-5300 Kerteminde, Denmark",University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover; University of Southern Denmark; Technical University of Denmark; University of Southern Denmark; Max Planck Society; Leibniz Institut fur die Padagogik der Naturwissenschaften und Mathematik an der Universitat Kiel (IPN); University of Southern Denmark,"Wahlberg, M (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Marine Biol Res Ctr, Hindsholmvej 11, DK-5300 Kerteminde, Denmark.",magnus@biology.sdu.dk,"Egemose, Henrik Dyrberg/P-7312-2018; Midtiby, Henrik Skov/A-9246-2008","Egemose, Henrik Dyrberg/0000-0002-6765-8216; Midtiby, Henrik Skov/0000-0002-3310-5680; Kindt-Larsen, Lotte/0000-0003-4696-5943; Brennecke, Dennis/0000-0003-3468-6592",European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF),European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF),"Field work was conducted within the project Reduction of harbor porpoise bycatch in protected areas, funded by European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), granted to LKL.",,53,3,3,4,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-7836,1872-6763,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,NOV,2022,255,,,,,,,,106437,10.1016/j.fishres.2022.106437,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.106437,,JUL 2022,11,Fisheries,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fisheries,5A9CV,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2023-11-27,WOS:000863178000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This puts pressure on capture fishery as fish is a preferred protein source worldwide. However, the more resources we put into the capture fisheries to obtain maximum catch, the faster the fisheries stock becomes depleted. The best option left to produce enough fish to meet demand is relying on advanced aquaculture. Unfortunately, the impact of technological advancement in the aquaculture sector is not profound compared to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The advent of Cloud computing, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence (CIA) has expanded numerous possibilities for applying and integrating information technology in all works of life. This article reviews the emergence of research development on CIA and the potential to revolutionize the aquaculture industry. The use of CIA techniques and tools such as drones, nano and micro-sensors, bionic robots, remote cameras, intelligent sorting, energy-saving processing equipment, statistical modules, and algorithms will reduce human intervention and increase aquaculture productivity. Also, the application of CIA in the aquaculture value chain to ensure effectiveness in traceability, feeding, disease detection, growth prediction, environmental monitoring, market information, and others is key to increasing aquaculture productivity and sustainability. Therefore, the future of aquaculture operations with less human labour, effective maintenance, and resource utilization largely depend on innovative technologies. Here, we outlined the need for adopting innovative technologies and the limiting factors that hinge on CIA adoption in the aquaculture industry.","[Mustapha, Umar Farouk; Jiang, Dong-Neng; Li, Guang-Li] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Guangdong Prov Famous Fish Reprod Regulat & Breed, Fisheries Coll, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China; [Alhassan, Abdul-Wadud] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Guangdong Ocean University; Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Li, GL (corresponding author), Guangdong Ocean Univ, Fisheries Coll, Zhanjiang 524088, Peoples R China.",ligl@gdou.edu.cn,"Mustapha, Umar Farouk/HJI-3744-2023","Mustapha, Umar Farouk/0000-0003-4193-6617","Key Project of Blue Granary Science and Technology Innovation of the Ministry of Science and Technology [2018YFD0901203]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31702326]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018B030311050, 2019A1515012042, 2019A1515010958]; Department of Education of Guangdong Province [2018KTSCX090]; Program for Scientific Research Start-Up Funds of Guangdong Ocean University",Key Project of Blue Granary Science and Technology Innovation of the Ministry of Science and Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Department of Education of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Program for Scientific Research Start-Up Funds of Guangdong Ocean University,This study was supported by grants from the Key Project of Blue Granary Science and Technology Innovation of the Ministry of Science and Technology (2018YFD0901203); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31702326); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2018B030311050; 2019A1515012042 and 2019A1515010958); Department of Education of Guangdong Province (2018KTSCX090); Program for Scientific Research Start-Up Funds of Guangdong Ocean University.,,94,22,22,10,102,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1753-5123,1753-5131,,REV AQUACULT,Rev.

Fisheries-independent data used to manage these ecologically and economically important species are frequently collected using diver- or snorkeler-based surveys, which have a number of limitations, including small spatial coverage and observer biases. In the present study, we explored how pairing traditional transect surveys with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning could improve sea cucumber density estimation in shallow environments. In July 2018, we conducted 24 simultaneous snorkeler-UAV transects in Tetiaroa, French Polynesia. All UAV images were independently reviewed by three observers and a convolution neural network (CNN) model: ResNet50. All three methods (snorkelers, manual review of UAV images, and ResNet50) produced similar counts, except at relatively high densities (similar to 75 sea cucumber 40 m(-2)), where UAVs and CNNs began to underestimate. Using a UAV-derived photomosaic of the study site, we simulated potential transect locations and determined a minimum of five samples were required to reliably estimate densities, while sample variance plateaued after 25 transects. Collectively, these results illustrate UAVs' ability to survey small invertebrate species, while saving time, money, and labour compared to traditional methods, and highlights their potential to maximize efficiency when designing transect surveys.","[Kilfoil, James P.; Rodriguez-Pinto, Ivan; Kiszka, Jeremy J.; Heithaus, Michael R.; Zhang, Yuying; Roa, Camilo C.] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Ailloud, Lisa E.] AOTTP, Int Commiss Conservat Atlantic Tunas, Corazon de Maria 8, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Campbell, Matthew D.] Mississippi Labs, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Pascagoula, MS 39567 USA; [Wirsing, Aaron J.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, 3715 West Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Kilfoil, JP (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",jkilf001@fiu.edu,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020; Ailloud, Lisa Elma/AAQ-5253-2021","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Ailloud, Lisa Elma/0000-0003-4701-9924; Kiszka, Jeremy/0000-0003-1095-8979",Florida International University Dissertation Year Fellowship,Florida International University Dissertation Year Fellowship,"The authors would like to thank the Seeley family, J.

Meanwhile, new technologies with applications in reef science and conservation are emerging at an ever faster rate and are simultaneously becoming cheaper and more accessible. Technology alone cannot save reefs, but it can potentially help scientists and conservation practitioners study, mitigate, and even solve key challenges facing coral reefs. We examine how new and emerging technologies are already being used for coral reef science and conservation. Examples include drones, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), 3D mapping and modeling tools, high resolution and nano satellite imagery, and a suite of monitoring and surveillance tools that are revolutionizing enforcement of sustainable reef fisheries. We argue that emerging technologies can play a pivotal role in tackling many of the critical issues facing coral reef conservation science and practice, but maximizing the impact of these technologies requires addressing several significant barriers. These barriers include lack of awareness of technologies and tools, prohibitive cost, lack of transferability across systems and/or scales, lack of technical expertise, and lack of accessibility. We discuss where analogous challenges have been overcome in another system and identify insights that can provide guidance for wise application of emerging technologies to coral reef science and conservation. Thoughtful consideration of, and adaptation to, these challenges will help us best harness the potential of emerging and future technological innovations to help solve the global coral reef crisis.","[Madin, Elizabeth M.

In the present study, the effectiveness of varying protection levels on the coastal fish populations within a multiple-use marine park in Greece was assessed through community-level metrics using a non-destructive underwater recording method (underwater drone/mini remotely operated vehicle). Two factors were examined, i.e. protection level (fully, partially and least protected area) and time period (early and late summer: beginning and towards the end of the fishing and touristic season). Our study demonstrated some first results that protection benefited both the commercial species and the entire fish community as a whole, in terms of diversity, abundance and richness, while non-commercial species did not differ among the studied protection levels. This finding, along with the fact that the prevailing conditions (water temperature, depth, habitat type) were similar in all three studied areas, that corresponded to different protection levels, and in both sampling periods, indicated that the observed results may be attributed to the varying protection levels. The studied fish communities did not seem to be affected by the more intense fishing and touristic period over the summer. In conclusion, protection from fishing seems to positively affect the studied coastal fish community as a whole and particularly the commercially important species that find a refuge within core areas of the Alonissos marine park.","[Nalmpanti, Melina; Pardalou, Androniki; Tsikliras, Athanassios C.; Dimarchopoulou, Donna] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Lab Ichthyol, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Dimarchopoulou, Donna] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries Anim & Vet Sci, Coll Environm & Life Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Rhode Island,"Dimarchopoulou, D (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Biol, Lab Ichthyol, Thessaloniki, Greece.;Dimarchopoulou, D (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Fisheries Anim & Vet Sci, Coll Environm & Life Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",ddimarch@bio.auth.gr,"Tsikliras, Athanassios C./G-6548-2015; Pardalou, Androniki/GMW-7856-2022; Dimarchopoulou, Donna/IYJ-5608-2023","Tsikliras, Athanassios C./0000-0002-9074-3259; Pardalou, Androniki/0000-0002-0566-0337; Dimarchopoulou, Donna/0000-0003-3412-3503",non-profit environmental organization 'Thalassa Foundation',non-profit environmental organization 'Thalassa Foundation',This work was supported by the non-profit environmental organization 'Thalassa Foundation'.,,78,1,1,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0025-3154,1469-7769,,J MAR BIOL ASSOC UK,J.

Aquaculture has increasingly become a source of seafood which spares the deleterious impact on wild fisheries. However, continually monitoring water quality to successfully grow and harvest fish is labor intensive. The Hybrid Aerial Underwater Robotic System (HAUCS) is an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for aquaculture farms to relieve the farm operators of one of the most labor-intensive and time-consuming farm operations: water quality monitoring. To this end, HAUCS employs a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones integrated with underwater measurement devices to collect the in situ water quality data from aquaculture ponds. A critical aspect in HAUCS is to develop an effective path planning algorithm to be able to sample all the ponds on the farm with minimal resources (i.e., the number of UAVs and the power consumption of each UAV). Three methods of path planning for the UAVs are tested, a Graph Attention Model (GAM), the Google Linear Optimization Package (GLOP) and our proposed solution, the HAUCS Path Planning Algorithm (HPP). The designs of these path planning algorithms are discussed, and a simulator is developed to evaluate these methods' performance. The algorithms are also experimentally validated at Southern Illinois University's Aquaculture Research Center to demonstrate the feasibility of HAUCS. Based on the simulations and experimental studies, HPP is particularly suited for large farms, while GLOP or GAM is more suited to small or medium-sized farms.","[Davis, Anthony; Wills, Paul S.; Fairman, William; Karim, Md Arshadul; Ouyang, Bing] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Ocean Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA; [Garvey, James E.] Southern Illinois Univ, Ctr Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Davis, A; Ouyang, B (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Ocean Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA.",anthonydavis2020@fau.edu; bouyang@fau.edu,"Garvey, Jim/A-4919-2012","Garvey, Jim/0000-0001-5393-9351; Ouyang, Bing/0000-0003-4663-8088",,,,,44,4,4,9,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Replacing divers with cameras has clear advantages, such as creating permanent records and accessing waters unavailable to divers. The use of cameras, however, typically produces large quantities of video that are time-consuming to process manually. Automated analysis of underwater videos from stationary cameras using deep learning techniques has advanced considerably in recent years, but the use of mobile cameras potentially raises new challenges for existing methods. We tested how well three automation procedures for stationary underwater cameras, taking an object-centric rather than background-centric approach, performed on surveys of fish using a mobile camera. We analyzed underwear drone videos from reef and seagrass habitat to detect and count two marine fisheries species, luderick (Girella tricuspidata) and yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis). Three convolutional neural network (CNN) frameworks were compared: Detectron Faster R-CNN, Detectron2 Faster R-CNN (using a Regional Proposal Network, RPN), and YOLOv5 (a single-stage detector, SSD). Models performed well overall. Per frame, overall F1 scores ranged 81.4 - 87.3%, precision 88.2 - 96.0%, and recall 73.2 - 88.2%. For quantifying MaxN per video, overall F1 ranged 85.9 - 91.4%, precision 81.9 - 95.3%, and recall 87.1 - 91.1%. For luderick, F1 was > 80% for all frameworks per frame and 89% or higher for MaxN. For yellowfin bream, F1 scores were lower (35.0 - 73.8% for frames, 43.4 - 73.0% for MaxN). Detectron2 performed poorly, and YOLOv5 and Detectron performed similarly with advantages depending on metrics and species. For these two frameworks, performance was as good as in videos from stationary cameras. Our findings show that object detection technology is very useful for extracting fish data from mobile underwater cameras for the system tested here. There is a need now to test performance over a wider range of environments to produce generalizable models. The key steps required area to test and enhance performance: 1. for suites of species in the same habitats with different water clarity, 2. in other coastal environments, 3. trialing cameras moving at different speeds, and 4. using different frame-rates.","[Connolly, Rod M.; Jinks, Kristin I.; Herrera, Cesar; Lopez-Marcano, Sebastian] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Coastal & Marine Res Ctr, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Lopez-Marcano, Sebastian] CSIRO, Quantitat Imaging Res Team, Epping, NSW, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Connolly, RM (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Coastal & Marine Res Ctr, Sch Environm & Sci, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",r.connolly@griffith.edu.au,"Connolly, Rod M/C-4094-2008; Herrera R, Csar A/ISV-2438-2023; Jinks, Kristin I/N-5807-2018; Herrera, Csar/AAI-3001-2021","Connolly, Rod M/0000-0001-6223-1291; Jinks, Kristin I/0000-0002-1899-3704; Herrera, Csar/0000-0003-0307-6724; Lopez-Marcano, Sebastian/0000-0002-0814-2906",Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC); Microsoft AI for Earth program; Global Wetland Project (GLOW),Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC); Microsoft AI for Earth program(Microsoft); Global Wetland Project (GLOW),"The work was supported by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), the Microsoft AI for Earth program, and the Global Wetland Project (GLOW), which draws support from a philanthropic trust that neither seeks nor permits publicity.",,62,1,1,10,17,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

To meet these objectives, a UUV system equipped with various scientific instruments has been implemented and in this work we present the first surveys carried out.","[Lambertini, A.; Mandanici, E.; Vittuari, L.] Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn DICAM, Bologna, Italy; [Menghini, M.; Castaldi, P.; De Marchi, L.] Univ Bologna, Dept Elect Elect & Informat Engn DEI Guglielmo Ma, Bologna, Italy; [Cimini, J.] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci BIGEA, Bologna, Italy; [Odetti, A.; Bruzzone, G.; Bibuli, M.; Caccia, M.] Inst Marine Engn CNR INM, Italian Natl Res Council, Genoa, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna; University of Bologna; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Lambertini, A (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Civil Chem Environm & Mat Engn DICAM, Bologna, Italy.",alessandro.lambertini@unibo.it; massimilian.menghin3@unibo.it; jacopo.cimini2@unibo.it; angelo.odetti@cnr.it; gabriele.bruzzone@cnr.it; marco.bibuli@cnr.it; emanuele.mandanici@unibo.it; luca.vittuari@unibo.it; paolo.castaldi@unibo.it; massimo.caccia@cnr.it; l.demarchi@unibo.it,"Castaldi, Paolo/AAG-1181-2020; Mandanici, Emanuele/L-8997-2015; Odetti, Angelo/O-2931-2015","Castaldi, Paolo/0000-0001-5754-5616; Mandanici, Emanuele/0000-0003-4822-1577; Odetti, Angelo/0000-0003-0338-0742",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [10046731],European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),"This research has been supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Interreg V-A, Italy-Croatia Cross-Border Cooperation Programme, within the SUSHI DROP (SUstainable fiSHeries wIth DROnes data Processing) project (Subsidy Contract n. 10046731).",,13,2,2,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-1458-6,,,,2021,,,,,,,189,193,,10.1109/MetroSea52177.2021.9611625,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MetroSea52177.2021.9611625,,,5,Instruments & Instrumentation; Oceanography; Remote Sensing,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Instruments & Instrumentation; Oceanography; Remote Sensing,BT2XT,,,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000815042200038,View Full Record in Web of Science

A single-beam echo sounder was used to collect bathymetry and seafloor substrate data, and an aerial drone collected lobster presence data through the georeferenced photography of lobster trap buoys. The SDMs display trends in lobster presence likelihood that correspond with established patterns of habitat selection in adult lobsters. The areas where lobsters are predicted to have the highest likelihood of presence are sections of hard and rocky substrate, though that association is confounded by depth. The uncertainty of the SDMs was quantitatively assessed and the importance of explicitly analysing the effects of scale and resolution of spatial data are highlighted.","[McKee, Anne; Grant, Jon; Barrell, Jeffrey] Dalhousie Univ, Oceanog Dept, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University,"McKee, A (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Oceanog Dept, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",anne.mckee@dal.ca,,,,,,,42,2,2,1,8,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",0706-652X,1205-7533,,CAN J FISH AQUAT SCI,Can.

For the 2 largest species, the blue whale Balaenoptera musculus and the fin whale B. physalus, reports of entangled individuals are rare, leading to the assumption that entanglements are not common. Studies of interaction with fisheries in other species often rely on the presence of scars from previous entanglements. Here, scar detection rates were first examined in humpback Megaptera novaeangliae, fin and blue whales using standard vessel-based photo-identification photographs collected between 2009 and 2016 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. We then examined aerial images of fin whales collected with a drone in 2018 and 2019 and compared both methods. Entanglement rates were 6.5% for fin and 13.1% for blue whales using photo-identification images of individuals. Prominent scarring was observed around the tail and caudal peduncle, visible only when animals lifted those body sections above water when diving. For the small subset of pictures which captured the entire caudal peduncle, entanglement rates ranged between 60% for blue and 80% for fin whales. This result was similar to the 85% entanglement rate estimated in humpback whales. The assessment of aerial-based photography yielded an entanglement rate of 44.1 to 54.7% in fin whales. Scars were always around the peduncle, often the tail, rarely the dorsal fin and never around the pectoral fins, while the mouth cannot be examined from above. Thus, in species that do not regularly expose their tail or peduncle, aerial imagery is the preferred method to quantify entanglement rates by assessment of scars.","[Ramp, Christian; Gaspard, David; Gavrilchuk, Katherine; Unger, Miranda; Schleimer, Anna; Delarue, Julien; Sears, Richard] Mingan Isl Cetacean Study, St Lambert, PQ J4P 1T3, Canada; [Ramp, Christian; Schleimer, Anna] Univ St Andrews, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Schleimer, Anna] Univ Groningen, Groningen Inst Evolutionary Life Sci, Marine Evolut & Conservat, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Landry, Scott] Ctr Coastal Studies, Provincetown, MA 02657 USA",University of St Andrews; University of Groningen,"Ramp, C (corresponding author), Mingan Isl Cetacean Study, St Lambert, PQ J4P 1T3, Canada.;Ramp, C (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sea Mammal Res Unit, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",cr43@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Ramp, Christian/0000-0001-5528-1733; Schleimer, Anna/0000-0002-9798-5074",DFO,DFO,"The Mingan Island Cetacean Study (MICS) acknowledges the effort and dedication of its team members and volunteers.

Intense exploitation over the past 65 years by a rapidly expanding high-seas fishing fleet has left many populations depleted, with consequences at the ecosystem level due to top-down control and trophic cascades. Despite increases in both CITES and IUCN Red Listings, the demographic trajectories of oceanic sharks and billfish are poorly quantified and resolved at geographic and population levels. Amongst MOFS trajectories, those of tunas are generally considered better understood, yet several populations remain either overfished or of unknown status. MOFS population trends and declines therefore remain contentious, partly due to challenges in deriving accurate abundance and biomass indices. Two major management strategies are currently recognised to address conservation issues surrounding MOFS: (i) internationally ratified legal frameworks and their associated regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs); and (ii) spatio-temporal fishery closures, including no-take marine protected areas (MPAs). In this context, we first review fishery-dependent studies relying on data derived from catch records and from material accessible through fishing extraction, under the umbrella of RFMO-administrated management. Challenges in interpreting catch statistics notwithstanding, we find that fishery-dependent studies have enhanced the accuracy of biomass indices and the management strategies they inform, by addressing biases in reporting and non-random effort, and predicting drivers of spatial variability across meso-and oceanic scales in order to inform stock assessments. By contrast and motivated by the increase in global MPA coverage restricting extractive activities, we then detail ways in which fishery-independent methods are increasingly improving and steering management by exploring facets of MOFS ecology thus far poorly grasped. Advances in telemetry are increasingly used to explore ontogenic and seasonal movements, and provide means to consider MOFS migration corridors and residency patterns. The characterisation of trophic relationships and prey distribution through biochemical analysis and hydro-acoustics surveys has enabled the tracking of dietary shifts and mapping of high-quality foraging grounds. We conclude that while a scientific framework is available to inform initial design and subsequent implementation ofMPAs, there is a shortage in the capacity to answer basic but critical questions about MOFS ecology (who, when, where?) required to track populations non-extractively, thereby presenting a barrier to assessing empirically the performance of MPA-based management for MOFS. This sampling gap is exacerbated by the increased establishment of large (> 10000 km(2)) and very large MPAs (VLMPAs, > 100000 km(2))-great expanses of ocean lacking effectivemonitoring strategies and survey regimes appropriate to those scales. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate the use of a non-extractive protocol to measure MOFS population recovery and MPA efficiency. We further identify technological avenues for monitoring at the VLMPA scale, through the use of spotter planes, drones, satellite technology, and horizontal acoustics, and highlight their relevance to the ecosystem-based framework of MOFS management.","[Letessier, Tom B.; Bouchet, Phil J.; Meeuwig, Jessica J.] Univ Western Australia M470, Ctr Marine Futures, Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Letessier, Tom B.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England; [Bouchet, Phil J.; Meeuwig, Jessica J.] Univ Western Australia M470, Sch Anim Biol, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia; Zoological Society of London; University of Western Australia,"Letessier, TB (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia M470, Ctr Marine Futures, Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.;Letessier, TB (corresponding author), Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England.",tom.letessier@uwa.edu.au,"Letessier, Tom Bech/AAV-2759-2020; Bouchet, Phil J/I-4360-2019","Letessier, Tom Bech/0000-0003-4011-0207; Bouchet, Phil J/0000-0002-2144-2049; Meeuwig, Jessica/0000-0003-1169-8785",Marine Biodiversity Hub through the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (NERP); Bertarelli Foundation,Marine Biodiversity Hub through the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (NERP)(Australian Government); Bertarelli Foundation,"T.B.L. and P.J.B. were supported by the Marine Biodiversity Hub through the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (NERP).

However, for inland water bodies in densely populated areas, this assumption may not be supported. In this study, we demonstrate variable stock recovery rates among different fish species with similar life histories in a large productive inland freshwater ecosystem (Kaunas Reservoir, Lithuania), where previously intensive commercial fishing has been banned since 2013. We conducted over 900 surveys of recreational anglers from 2016 to 2021 to document recreational fishing catches and combined these catch estimates with drone and fishfinder device-based assessments of recreational fishing effort. Fish population recovery rates were assessed using a standardized catch-per-unit-effort time series in independent scientific surveys. We show that recreational fishing is slowing the recovery of predatory species, such as pikeperch Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758) and Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758. The estimated annual recreational catches for these species were 19 tons (min-max of 7-55 tons) and 9 tons (4-28), respectively, which was considerably higher than the average commercial catch before the fishery closure (10 and 1 tons, respectively). In contrast, the recovery of roach Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), rarely caught by anglers (annual recreational catch of ca 3 tons compared to ca 100 tons of commercial catch), has been rapid, and the species is now dominating the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates that recreational fishing can have strong and selective impacts on fish species, reduce predator abundance, alter relative species composition and potentially change ecosystem state and dynamics.","[Dainys, Justas; Jakubaviciute, Egle; Gorfine, Harry; Kirka, Mindaugas; Rakleviciute, Alina; Morkvenas, Augustas; Putys, Zilvinas; Lozys, Linas; Audzijonyte, Asta] Nat Res Ctr, Akademijos Str 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Gorfine, Harry] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Audzijonyte, Asta] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia",Nature Research Center - Lithuania; University of Melbourne; University of Tasmania,"Dainys, J (corresponding author), Nat Res Ctr, Akademijos Str 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania.",justas.dainys@gamtc.lt,"Morkv?nas, Augustas/HKO-1503-2023","Morkv?nas, Augustas/0000-0002-0179-715X; Audzijonyte, Asta/0000-0002-9919-9376; Gorfine, Harry/0000-0001-6933-3389",European Regional Development Fund [01.2.2-LMT-K-718-02-0006]; Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT),European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This study has received funding from the European Regional Development Fund (project no. 01.2.2-LMT-K-718-02-0006) under a grant agreement with the Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT).,,72,4,4,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2410-3888,,FISHES-BASEL,Fishes,OCT,2022,7,5,,,,,,,232,10.3390/fishes7050232,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes7050232,,,17,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,5O3YB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2023-11-27,WOS:000872412000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In intertidal and inshore fisheries in which vessel monitoring systems (VMS) or logbook programmes may not be implemented, quantifying the distribution and intensity of fishing can be difficult. The most obvious effects of bottom-contact fishing are often physical changes to the habitat, such as scarring of the sediment following dredging or trawling. We explored the potential of applying remote sensing techniques to aerial imagery collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone, in an area of intertidal mud flat (0.52 km(2)) in Poole Harbour, UK, where shellfish dredging is widely carried out and conflicts between commercial fishing interests and the conservation of internationally important shorebird populations are a concern. Image classification and image texture analysis were performed on imagery collected during the open dredge season in November 2015, in order to calculate measures of fishing intensity across three areas of the harbour subject to different management measures. We found a significant correlation between results of the image texture analysis and official sightings records collected during the dredging season, indicating that this method most accurately quantified dredging disturbance. The relationship between shorebird densities and food intake rates and the results of this analysis method were then investigated to assess the potential for using remotely sensed measures of fishing effort to assess responses of overwintering shorebird populations to intertidal shellfish dredging. Our work highlights the application of such methods, providing a low-cost tool for quantifying fishing effort and predicting wildlife conflicts.","[Clarke, L.

Towards this goal, coastal monitoring programs and studies must deliver information on a range of variables and factors, from taxonomic/functional diversity and spatial distribution of habitats, to anthropogenic stress indicators such as land use, fisheries use, and pollution. Effective monitoring programs must therefore integrate observations from different sources and spatial scales to provide a comprehensive view to managers.

We: (i) map depth and substrate of shallow rocky habitats, and; (ii) classify the major biotopes associated with these environmental axes; and (iii) combine data from i and ii to assess the likely distribution of common sessile organismal assemblages over the survey area. Finally, we propose a general workflow that can be adapted to different needs and aerial platforms, which can be used as blueprints for further integration of remote-sensing with in situ surveys to produce spatially-explicit biotope maps.","[Monteiro, Joao Gama; Jimenez, Jesus L.; Gizzi, Francesca; Prikryl, Petr; Canning-Clode, Joao] MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, ARDITI Agencia Reg Desenvolvimento Invest Tecnol, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal; [Prikryl, Petr] Univ Ostrava, Dept Biol & Ecol, Fac Sci, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Lefcheck, Jonathan S.] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Tennenbaum Marine Observ Network, MarineGEO, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Santos, Ricardo S.] Minist Sea, Ave Doutor Alfredo Magalhaes Ramalho, P-1465165 Alges, Portugal; [Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Horta, Portugal; [Canning-Clode, Joao] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA",University of Ostrava; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; Universidade dos Acores; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center,"Monteiro, JG (corresponding author), MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, ARDITI Agencia Reg Desenvolvimento Invest Tecnol, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal.",jmonteiro@mare-centre.pt,"Canning-Clode, Joao/I-4343-2019; Lefcheck, Jonathan/H-8768-2019; Santos, Ricardo Serro/B-3960-2008; GIZZI, FRANCESCA/K-5469-2015","Canning-Clode, Joao/0000-0003-2143-6535; Lefcheck, Jonathan/0000-0002-8787-1786; Santos, Ricardo Serro/0000-0002-2536-1369; Monteiro, Joao/0000-0002-3401-6495; Jimenez Lopez, Jesus/0000-0003-0543-7992; GIZZI, FRANCESCA/0000-0001-9447-8694","Erasmus+ programme of the European Union; FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P., under the Scientific Employment Stimulus-Institutional Call [CEECINST/00098/2018]; project CleanAtlantic; project INTERREG Atlantic Area Programme; project PLASMAR+ [MAC2/1.1a/347]; INTERREG MAC 2014-2020 Programme; Net-Biome SeaProlif, ERA-NET, FRCT; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [UIDB/04292/2020]; [M1420-09-5369-FSE-000002]; [ARDITI-RAGES-2019-001]; [ARDITI-OOM/2018/001]","Erasmus+ programme of the European Union(Erasmus+); FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, I.P., under the Scientific Employment Stimulus-Institutional Call(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); project CleanAtlantic; project INTERREG Atlantic Area Programme; project PLASMAR+; INTERREG MAC 2014-2020 Programme; Net-Biome SeaProlif, ERA-NET, FRCT; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); ; ;","JM and FG are supported by post-doctoral research fellowships [M1420-09-5369-FSE-000002] and [ARDITI-RAGES-2019-001] respectively.

Here, we tested the use of a UAV (DJI Phantom II (R)) to assess fine-scale variation in densities of 2 elasmobranchs (blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus and pink whiprays Himantura fai) on reef systems off Moorea (French Polynesia). We flew parallel transects designed to sample reef habitats (fringing, channel and sandflat habitats) across 2 survey blocks. Block 1 included a shark and ray provisioning site with potentially higher elasmobranch densities, whereas Block 2 most likely had lower densities with no provisioning activities. Across 10 survey days in July 2014, we flew 3 transects (400 m) within each survey block (n = 60 total transect passes). As expected, densities (animals ha(-1)) were significantly higher in Block 1 than in Block 2, particularly where provisioning activities occur. Differences between habitats surveyed were also found. Our study provides the first direct estimates of shark and ray densities in coral-reef ecosystems and demonstrates that UAVs can produce important fishery-independent data for elasmobranchs, particularly in shallow-water habitats.","[Kiszka, Jeremy J.; Gastrich, Kirk; Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Mourier, Johann] UPVD, LabEx CORAIL, CNRS, USR 3278,EPHE,CRIOBE, BP 1013, Papetoai 98729, Moorea, France; [Mourier, Johann] PSL Res Univ, UPVD, LabEx CORAIL, EPHE,CNRS,USR 3278,CRIOBE, F-66360 Perpignan, France",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE),"Kiszka, JJ (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",jkiszka@fiu.edu,"Heithaus, Michael/AAF-9914-2020; Johann, Mourier/B-4881-2012; Kiszka, Jeremy J./AAH-2588-2020","Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Johann, Mourier/0000-0001-9019-1717; Kiszka, Jeremy J./0000-0003-1095-8979",Save our Seas Foundation (Small grant) [SOSF 283],Save our Seas Foundation (Small grant),"We thank Dr. Serge Planes and personnel from USR 3278 CNRS-EPHE/Centre de Recherche Insulaire et Observatoire de l'Environnement (CRIOBE), for facilitating this research in Moorea.

An important bias in acoustic surveys is that fish may avoid the survey vessel. Here, we utilized quiet uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) equipped with 120 kHz split beam echosounders to evaluate fish responses to motorized survey vessels. Two of these USVs were deployed in Lakes Michigan and Huron in summer 2021 and compared against three motorized vessels used in conventional fisheries acoustic surveys. Paired comparisons employed vessel-drone passes that provided the opportunity to observe fish response as vessels approached and then overtook their quiet USV counterparts. Sound originating from the vessels was primarily in the 10-1000 Hz range. Overall received sound pressure levels for ships at the closest pass were 100 dB (re 1 mu Pa @ 1 m) for one and 133-134 dB for the other two vessels. In contrast, sound originating from the USV was not detectable over ambient noise. We examined acoustic data from the USVs for potential changes in total acoustic backscatter, average target depth, and average in situ target strength as vessels approached. We observed weak evidence of an avoidance response by fish to the vessel with the loudest noise profile and highest survey speed but not for the other two vessels. We also compared acoustic data from 33 2-km transects surveyed by both vessels and the USVs, finding few differences between vessel and USV data for water depths between 5 and 80 m. Results from this work suggest that acoustics estimates of fishes in Lakes Michigan and Huron (primarily alewife, rainbow smelt, and bloater) are largely consistent among the vessels used in these two lakes for standard acoustic surveys and that fish avoidance is minimal in water depths > 5 meters.","[Evans, Thomas M.; Rudstam, Lars G.; Watkins, James M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Fernow Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Sethi, Suresh A.] Cornell Univ, New York Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Ithaca, NY USA; [Sethi, Suresh A.] Alaska Pacific Univ, Fisheries Aquat Sci & Technol Lab, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Warner, David M.; Farha, Steven A.; DuFour, Mark R.; O'Brien, Timothy P.; Dieter, Patricia M.; Esselman, Peter C.] US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, 1451 Green Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Hanson, S.

Yellow Creek in the upper Bear River watershed (Utah and Wyoming) contains one of the largest remaining populations of Northern Leatherside Chub Lepidomeda copei, an imperiled fish. Lower reaches are drying during summer months, partly due to water withdrawals, thus reducing Northern Leatherside Chub populations and relegating the remaining fish to isolated pools until the water returns. This study used an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture high-resolution and spatially explicit imagery over 19 km of Yellow Creek in a few weeks during late August when the water is the most limiting to the fish. Through imagery and subsequent GIS analysis, we identified 405 previously unknown potential refuge-pool habitats for Northern Leatherside Chub and determined their location, size, and spatial distribution, thereby helping managers prioritize stream reaches for native fish conservation and restoration. While the cost of unmanned aerial vehicle flights was estimated to be 2.5 times that of on-the-ground surveys in 2016, unmanned aerial vehicle technology continues to become more cost effective and, unlike traditional surveys, provides high-resolution and spatially referenced data.","[Thompson, Paul D.] Utah Dept Nat Resources, 1594 West North Temple, Salt Lake City, UT 84114 USA; [Vasquez, Emanuel A.; Jones, Allison] Wild Utah Project, 824 South 400 West,Suite B-119, Salt Lake City, UT 84101 USA; [Gowing, Ian] Utah State Univ, Utah Water Res Lab, 1600 Canyon Rd Logan, Salt Lake City, UT 84321 USA; [Edgar, Tim] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, 260 Cent Campus Dr 4625, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Neville, Ann] Nature Conservancy, Utah Off, 559 East South Temple, Salt Lake City, UT 84102 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Jones, A (corresponding author), Wild Utah Project, 824 South 400 West,Suite B-119, Salt Lake City, UT 84101 USA.",allieleejones@gmail.com,,"Thompson, Paul/0000-0002-2346-3927",Nature Conservancy-Utah Chapter; Utah Department of Natural Resources Endangered Species Mitigation Fund; Utah Division of Wildlife Resources; Wyoming Game and Fish Department,Nature Conservancy-Utah Chapter; Utah Department of Natural Resources Endangered Species Mitigation Fund; Utah Division of Wildlife Resources; Wyoming Game and Fish Department,"This project was completed thanks to the financial and technical support of The Nature Conservancy-Utah Chapter.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have an unprecedented potential for measuring these changes by mapping indicator species such as penguins even in remote areas. We used a battery-powered fixed-wing UAV to survey colonies along a 30-km stretch of the remote coast of southwest King George Island and northwest Nelson Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) during the austral summer 2016/17. With multiple flights, we covered a total distance of 317 km. We determined the exact position of 14 chinstrap penguin colonies, including two small unknown colonies, with a total abundance of 35,604 adults. To model the number of occupied nests based on the number of adults counted in the UAV imagery we used data derived from terrestrial time-lapse imagery. The comparison with previous studies revealed a decline in the total abundance of occupied nests. However, we also found four chinstrap penguin colonies that have grown since the 1980s against the general trend on the South Shetland Islands.

Being able to walk right up to a whale, and even look inside its body, offers scientists and stranding network volunteers a rare and meaningful opportunity to learn from whales at close range. On 14 March 2021, a female adult humpback whale was found dead on a beach near Sitka, Alaska. A team of volunteers performed a necropsy, meaning they dissected the whale to gather information about its cause of death and collected samples for further research (NOAA Fisheries permit 18786-01). Before, during and after the necropsy, the whale was three-dimensionally (3D) scanned using a drone and an iPad. These scans were annotated and arranged into a free publicallyavailable resource known as the 4D virtual necropsy (with time as the 4th dimension). After one month, we documented broad interest in this resource from researchers, educators, community members, and volunteers who respond to marine mammal strandings. We believe 3D scanning of future stranded animals will be useful for a wide range of applications. Stranded large whales represent an opportunity to learn about the anatomy and health of these cryptic free-ranging animals. However, where time and access is frequently limited, law enforcement and management priorities often take precedence over research, outreach, and educational uses. On 14 March 2021, a dead female adult humpback whale was reported stranded on an uninhabited island 15 miles west of Sitka, Alaska. The whale was three-dimensionally scanned using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and photogrammetry before, during, and at multiple time points after a necropsy, including full decomposition 17 days later (NOAA Fisheries permit 18786-01).

Aquatic weeds that grow to high densities cause decreases in the oxygen concentration in the water, accumulation of sludge, and adverse effects on water use facilities and fisheries. Although there are large machines for cutting and harvesting aquatic plants, their use is limited due to their high cost, large size, and heavy weight. On the other hand, manual cutting is very labor intensive and inefficient. Therefore, in this research, we developed a labor-saving and low-cost robot boat to mow aquatic plants. This robot boat is automatically controlled by a real-time kinematic global navigational satellite system (RTK-GNSS) and is characterized by its small size, light weight, excellent portability, and low energy consumption. In addition, a paddle mechanism that replaces a conventional propeller was introduced as a propulsion mechanism to prevent entanglement of water plants and enable longterm automatic navigation. Mowing lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) in Lake Izunuma, Miyagi prefecture, Japan, confirmed that mowing could be properly conducted with a lateral deviation of 9.4 cm, average speed of 0.41 m s(-1), and average power consumption of 518 W even when lotus was at its densest growth. If the cutting width of the robot boat was 1.2 m and the sidelap width was 0.3 m, the theoretical field work rate would be 0.133 ha h(-1). Images captured by a drone confirmed that cutting with the robot boat was effective in suppressing the growth of lotus. It was found that the effect of suppressing growth was maximized by mowing at the time when the stopping leaves appeared in the late growth stage of lotus.","[Kaizu, Yutaka; Igarashi, Sho; Furuhashi, Kenichi; Imou, Kenji] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Shimada, Tetsuo; Takahashi, Yusuke] Miyagi Prefectural Izunuma Uchinuma Environm Fdn, Kurihara, Miyagi, Japan; [Yamada, Hiroyuki] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",University of Tokyo; Hokkaido University,"Kaizu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",kaizu@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [1-1602]","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan)","This research was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (1-1602) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.

Mapping is a fundamental activity that underpins our understanding of coral reef environments and helps to shape policies in resource management and conservation. This is particularly the case for quantifying the area of landcover types associated with reef environments, including coral patches, seagrasses and mangroves, but also for monitoring how these change over time and modelling how spatial patterns apparent on reefs are related to environmental drivers. Field techniques and aerial photography have historically played a crucial role in mapping coral reef environments, which has recently seen a transition toward the processing of satellite remote sensing images. This paper examines a series of maps produced of Low Isles, the most mapped island on the Great Barrier Reef, to review historical methods for mapping coral reefs because of the critical importance of understanding how past maps were made, which determines appropriate uses to which they can be put. Recent advances and future opportunities for the application of mapping technologies to coral reefs are also evaluated, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms for airborne surveys, delivery of information through web-based platforms and improvements in the quality of information for making and presenting maps. Maps have transformed the way we have responded to both historic and contemporary coral reef problems. This timely review communicates how maps, and the fast growing technologies that are employed to produce them, are central to our understanding of coral reef environments. Recent advances that may drive exciting new environmental management tools are identified.","[Hamylton, Sarah M.] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Hamylton, SM (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",shamylto@uow.edu.au,,"Hamylton, Sarah/0000-0002-6256-3728",,,,,135,35,37,6,148,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

Some provinces such as Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, Riau, South Sumatra, and Jambi have been covered in a thick and poisonous haze for months. The total number of fire in Central Kalimantan processed from NASA hotspot data from January to October is reaches 10 000, which approximately 86% occur during two months of the dry season (September - October 2019). The areas that experienced very severe fires in 2019 were Peat Hydrological Unit (PHU) Kahayan - Sebangau River in the administrative boundaries of Pulang Pisau and Palangka Raya. The interesting is the fire in 2019 becomes the four of top fire in Central Kalimantan after 2015, 2006 and 2009. About 10,000 hectares of land including peatlands have been burned only in Central Kalimantan during the forest and land fires season. The smoldering type of peat combustion underground with low-temperature combustion is the most common occurrence in dry peatland areas. This unique fire behavior answers some of the questions why smoldering fires occur over long durations, and why peat fires are difficult to extinguish and produce more smoke. This paper will review the update of 2019's fire in Central Kalimantan and introduce the methods and approaches of firefighting by the local community. The method that will be presented is a combination of scientific data with the experience of the firefighting team, which is called Tim Serbu Api Kelurahan (TSAK). The collaboration project between the University of Palangka Raya, Kyoto University and CIFOR that supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery Japan has proposed to draft a manual for fire prevention and protection for the local fire fighting. This manual covers the method of fire investigation, firefighting preparedness such as making wellbore, fire break, the installation on machine and horse as well as the effective peat rewetting and watering. This method has been tested successfully to slow the movement and spread of fire under thick peat. On the other hand, there is still a need for sophisticated equipment for underground fire detection such as thermal cameras or drones.","[Yulianti, Nina; Kusin, Kitso; Jagau, Yusurum] Univ Palangka Raya, UPT LLG CIMTROP, Jalan Yos Sudarso, Kota Palangka Raya 73112, Kalimantan Teng, Indonesia; [Naito, Daisuke] Kyoto Univ, Fac Agr, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Naito, Daisuke; Susetyo, Kurniawan Eko] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Jalan CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Indonesia",Universitas Palangka Raya (UPR); Kyoto University; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Yulianti, N (corresponding author), Univ Palangka Raya, UPT LLG CIMTROP, Jalan Yos Sudarso, Kota Palangka Raya 73112, Kalimantan Teng, Indonesia.",ninayulianti.unpar@gmail.com,,"Kusin, Kitso/0000-0001-6019-0828","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery Japan (MAFF); Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery Japan (MAFF); Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education","Great thanks to BPBD Pusdalops of Central Kalimantan for the fire incidents data.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide alternatives to manned aircraft and walk-over (WO) surveys. To support coastal managers with method selection, we compare the costs and benefits of the three techniques using the extent of bait collection (sediment scarring from manual digging) on intertidal mudflats from three UK sites. UAV and WO surveys were conducted in parallel and aerial photography was downloaded from the Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO). Digging was digitised from estimations on foot (WO) or by manually labelling imagery with confidence assigned (UAV/CCO). Method efficacy is compared with respect to spatial coverage, control over survey time/location, spatial resolution, positioning accuracy, and area of digging detected. Personnel hours and up-front costs (e.g. training/equipment), costs for personnel time standardised by shore area, personnel risk, and environmental impact are also compared. Regarding efficacy, CCO imagery had extensive shore coverage compared to UAV and WO, however, assessments are restricted to times/locations with available imagery. Each method's resolution was sufficient to detect digging. WO achieved the highest resolution (on foot), but the lowest positioning accuracy, in contrast to accurate feature delineation on aerial imagery. An additive two-way ANOVA revealed a significantly higher percent area of 'dug' sediment (all confidence levels) recorded by UAV than WO. CCO was the most cost-effective with no fieldwork/equipment costs. UAV had the highest up-front costs, but WO was more costly for personnel hours/ km2 for survey time and digitisation. For all methods, digitisation was the most time-consuming aspect. Compared to WO, UAV achieved rapid shore surveys and the CCO and UAV methods minimise personnel risks. UAV and WO both cause wildlife disturbance, with trampling an additional WO impact. With each method suited to sediment disturbance assessment, selection will depend on resources and objectives and will be aided by this holistic cost-benefit analysis. Cost-effectiveness will improve with evolving regulations that facilitate UAV use and technological developments (e.g. machine learning for disturbance detection) that could significantly expedite imagery analysis and enable broadscale assessments from CCO or satellite imagery.","[White, Shannon M.; Barfield, Peter; Watson, Gordon J.] Univ Portsmouth, Inst Marine Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Ferry Rd, Portsmouth PO4 9LY, Hampshire, England; [Schaefer, Martin] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Environm Geog & Geosci, Buckingham Bldg,L Terrace, Portsmouth PO1 3HE, Hampshire, England; [Cantrell, Ruth] Nat England, Foss House, Kings Pool, 1-2 Peasholme Green, York YO1 7PX, North Yorkshire, England; [White, Shannon M.] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England",University of Portsmouth; University of Portsmouth; Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science,"White, SM (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Inst Marine Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Ferry Rd, Portsmouth PO4 9LY, Hampshire, England.",shannon.white@cefas.co.uk; martin.schaefer@port.ac.uk; peter.barfield@port.ac.uk; Ruth.Cantrell@naturalengland.org.uk; gordon.watson@port.ac.uk,"Watson, Gordon J/D-4385-2009","Schaefer, Martin/0000-0003-4905-1354; Barfield, Peter/0000-0003-1101-4937; Watson, Gordon/0000-0001-8274-7658",Natural England [ECM_51116]; University of Portsmouth,Natural England; University of Portsmouth,"Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge the financial support of Natural England (Contract Reference: ECM_51116) .

Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) has been developed in order to perform difficult missions as a substitute of manned vehicle in bad sea weather condition. USV is a small boat as a kind of small MASS and it can be controlled remotely or autonomously. Since 2011, Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering (KRISO) have developed ARAGON as a multi-purpose intelligent unmanned surface vehicle (USV) under the financial support of KOREA Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Three prototypes USV ARAGON1, ARAGON2, ARAGON3 have been built and they have planning hulls with diesel engine and waterjet. They have the length of 8 meters and the displacement of about 3 tons. On the other hand, because USV has various merits of higher payloads and longer operation time in sea area than aerial drone and multiple USVs are more effective for maritime mission such as intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance than single USV, a lot of research and development projects on USV swarm have been conducted. In KRISO, a new research project entitled with Development of situation awareness and autonomous navigation technology of unmanned surface vehicle based on the artificial intelligence has been studied for the development of the operation system of USV swarm for illegal ship control support and sea surveillance since 2019. For this, swarm autonomous navigation system (SANS) for remote control, path following, collision avoidance and illegal ship chasing has been developed by using four USVs, which are ARAGON1, ARAGON2, ARAGON3 and KOMBO. For safe navigation among four USVs swarm, they should keep the convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea, 1972 (COLREGs). Collision avoidance algorithm in SANS is implemented by using changeable action space searching, which can be flexibly changed according to the collision risk (CR) based on fuzzy inference. Each USV can navigate autonomously without human operation by using SANS. In the ground control station the navigational information and the status of four USVs are remotely monitored through LTE communication. In the lake, field tests are carried out in order to validate the collision avoidance algorithm among four USVs swarm. Scenarios are tested on the simultaneous colliding situations such as head-on, crossing and their combinations among four USVs swarm. In this paper, the main features of SANS and main results of field tests on autonomous collision avoidance among four USVs swarm are described.","[Son, Nam-Sun; Park, Han-Sol; Pyo, Chun-Seon] Korea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn KRISO, Ocean & Maritime Digital Technol Res Div, Daejeon, South Korea",Korea Research Institute of Ships & Ocean Engineering,"Son, NS (corresponding author), Korea Res Inst Ships & Ocean Engn KRISO, Ocean & Maritime Digital Technol Res Div, Daejeon, South Korea.",nsson@kriso.re.kr; hspark@kriso.re.kr; cspyo@kriso.re.kr,,,"Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering (KRISO) [PES3880, PES4270, PES4710]",Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering (KRISO),"This research is conducted in a research and development project Development of situation awareness and autonomous navigation technology of unmanned surface vehicle based on the artificial intelligence (PES3880, PES4270, PES4710) under financial support of Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering (KRISO).",,16,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,979-8-3503-3226-1,,,,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/OCEANSLimerick52467.2023.10244483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OCEANSLimerick52467.2023.10244483,,,6,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Oceanography,BV8AH,,,,,2023-11-27,WOS:001074614700193,View Full Record in Web of Science
