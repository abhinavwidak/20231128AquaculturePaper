IoT technologies are exploited to enhance productivity in aquaculture sites by maintaining precise operating conditions and to avoid undesirable situations. Currently, human intervention is still needed to make good decisions, dependant on the values of parameters detected by sensors, often captured at one point in time in a day. This is not only a time-consuming task but also an inaccurate one since parameters, such as water quality, evolves continuously and affects the whole aquaculture system. This is mainly caused by the lack of information collection, exchange and process automation between different actors in aquaculture farms. To overcome these problems, technologies such as semantic Web technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI), are bringing new capabilities to organise data in an inter-operable way to then be processed and used for monitoring and decision-making. In this context, we are proposing in this paper a fully semantic based-reference data model for Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) that involves the collection, processing, and sharing of data both between components and between the platform and external aqua-systems by supporting IoT and data information standards. It is based on analysis of the current data models and covers the core concepts required for aquaculture management and has been validated against several business scenarios.","[Abid, Ahmed; Dupont, Charlotte; Le Gall, Franck] Easy Global Market, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Third, Allan] Open Univ, KMi Knowledge Media, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Kane, Frank] Marine Inst, Galway, Ireland",Open University - UK; Marine Institute Ireland,"Abid, A (corresponding author), Easy Global Market, Sophia Antipolis, France.",ahmed.abid@eglobalmark.com; charlotte.dupont@eglobalmark.com; franck.legall@eglobalmark.com; allan.third@open.ac.uk; frank.kane@marine.ie,"A Samah, Azurah/ABB-2436-2021","LE GALL, Franck/0000-0001-8467-0017; Hashim, Haslina/0000-0003-0048-719X; Kane, Frank/0000-0001-8847-534X; Abid, Ahmed/0000-0002-5321-9247",European Union [774109]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [774109] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020),"The research leading to these results has been supported by the IMPAQT project, which receives funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under grant agreement No. 774109.

However, in spite of the popularity of these technologies for fish farming in other parts of the world, Brazil still lags behind. To fill this gap, this study has conducted the first field study in implementing the IoT sensor technologies in Southern Brazil and documents the experiences in this paper. More specifically, it discusses developing sustainable artisanal fisheries infrastructure using these technologies with reference to southern Brazil, where the study explores the use of sensor technology in aquaculture and its effectiveness in reducing waste and improving productivity. The overarching goal of the project is to demonstrate how simple data collection using IoT sensors and its analysis can support artisanal freshwater fish farms in Brazil and beyond to increase production, reduce waste, and thereby improve their sustainability. The pilot implementation of these technologies has demonstrated the potential of increasing the productivity of the artisanal fisheries, reducing waste (e.g., loss of farmed fish, optimised feeding to reduce waste of feeds), and improving the sustainability of aquaculture. This paper documents the valuable firsthand experiences of selecting, adapting, and implementing the IoT sensor technologies with close cooperation from local research institutions and artisanal fish farmers.

BFT is considered an innovative alternative for solving the problems of traditional aquaculture (for example, envi-ronmental pollution, high maintenance costs, and low productivity). Extensive research is being conducted to apply BFT to breed and raise many aquatic animal species. In BFT, maintaining an appropriate C:N ratio by adding a carbon source promotes the growth of microorganisms in water and maintains the aquaculture water quality through microbial processes such as nitrification. For the efficient use and sustainability of BFT, various factors such as total suspended solids, water turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and salinity, stocking density, and light should be considered. The application of the transformative fourth industrial revolution technologies, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT), to aquaculture can reduce the risk factors and manual interventions in aquaculture through automation and intelligence. The combination of ICT/IoT with BFT can enable real-time monitoring of the necessary elements of BFT farming using various sensors, which is expected to increase productivity by ensuring the growth and health of the or-ganisms being reared.","[Yu, Young-Bin; Lee, Ju-Hyeong; Choi, Jae-Ho; Kang, Ju-Chan] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Aquat Life Med, Busan, South Korea; [Choi, Young Jae] Natl Inst Fisheries Sci, Inland Fisheries Res Inst, Geumsan, South Korea; [Jo, A-Hyun; Kim, Jun-Hwan] Sun Moon Univ, Dept Aquat Life & Med Sci, Asan, South Korea; [Choi, Cheol Young] Korea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Div Marine Biosci, Busan 49112, South Korea",Pukyong National University; National Institute of Fisheries Science; Sun Moon University; Korea Maritime & Ocean University,"Kang, JC (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Aquat Life Med, Busan, South Korea.;Kim, JH (corresponding author), Sun Moon Univ, Dept Aquat Life & Med Sci, Asan, South Korea.;Choi, CY (corresponding author), Korea Maritime & Ocean Univ, Div Marine Biosci, Busan 49112, South Korea.",choic@kmou.ac.kr; jckang@pknu.ac.kr; junhwan1982@sunmoon.ac.kr,,,"National Institute of Fisheries Science, Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea [R2023017]","National Institute of Fisheries Science, Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea","This research was supported by the National Institute of Fisheries Science, Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea (R2023017) .",,106,2,2,33,33,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

This analysis was performed extensively from May to December 2020 by meticulously selecting a total of 30 internationally published research papers. This review is divided into five categories: (1) recent research (2011-2020), (2) aquaculture environments, (3) research approaches, (4) most common water quality parameters and (5) forms of the solution provided. Most of the published research concentrated on inland aquaculture (81%), while research articles on marine aquaculture species accounted for 19% of papers reviewed so far. The framework and architecture approach (48%) was the most widely practised research approach in IoT-based aquaculture for water quality monitoring. There is a need for long-term experimental research to identify the challenges and suggest appropriate solutions. With regards to water quality parameters, temperature (20%), dissolved oxygen (18%) and pH (17%) are the topmost prioritised water quality parameters considered in the IoT-based aquaculture. Finally, real-time monitoring (50%) is offered generally as a form of a solution while autonomous (3%) monitoring can be a unique solution.

The LoRa gateway and Raspberry Pi are implemented to transfer the aquaculture field parameters into the database and presented on the Website. With the remote monitoring screen, users can keep tracking changes of water quality and make timely adjustments without going in and out of the aquaculture site frequently.","[Hsieh, Chang-Wei; Tsai, Yun Ju] Asia Univ, Dept Photon & Commun Engn, Taichung, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Chang-Wei] Asia Univ, Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung, Taiwan; [Stefanie, Corine] Airlangga Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Wang, Charles C.

In recent years, information and communication technologies (ICT) have been implemented to monitor, control, correct and even predict the behavior of critical parameters in fish farms to obtain sustainable productivity. A systematic literature review (SLR) was applied to identify the main variables contributing to the increase in sustainable productivity in freshwater aquaculture and the most used ICT tools to monitor or control these variables. It was found that aquaculture uses IoT and AI mainly on five fronts: water quality, fish feeding, water recirculation, fish transport and traceability, and fish welfare. The use of ICT tools in aquaculture has evolved from the use of simple sensors to the construction of predictive models using deep learning. However, it is worth highlighting the few articles that evaluate the impact of ICT tools on the productivity metrics of a freshwater fish farm under real conditions, and the information presented in the reviewed literature is difficult to compare due to the lack of uniformity in aquaculture projects where ICT tools are applied.","[Bernal-Higuita, Faisal; Acosta-Coll, Melisa; De-la-Hoz-Franco, Emiro] Univ la Costa, Dept Comp Sci & Elect, Barranquilla 080020, Colombia; [Ballester-Merelo, Francisco] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Elect Engn, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Bernal-Higuita, Faisal] St 5855-66, Barranquilla, Colombia",Universidad de la Costa; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Bernal-Higuita, F (corresponding author), St 5855-66, Barranquilla, Colombia.",fbernal@cuc.edu.co; macosta10@cuc.edu.co; fballest@eln.upv.es; edelahoz@cuc.edu.co,"Acosta, Melisa/AAW-1432-2021; Merelo, Francisco/Y-9526-2018","Acosta, Melisa/0000-0002-5433-0414; Merelo, Francisco/0000-0002-2464-5116; De-La-Hoz-Franco, Emiro/0000-0002-4926-7414",,,,,129,2,2,8,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-6526,1879-1786,,J CLEAN PROD,J.

Traditional IoT systems can offer monitoring capabilities. However, this emerging application requires real-time control-based actuation to intervene in the environment. Often, farmers have limited time to react to any anomalous event.

Aquaculture farmers prioritise early diagnosis for timely treatment to achieve better productive and economic performance. Aquatic animal health experts still employ traditional diagnostic methods using visual diagnosis, cell culture, media culture, histopathology and serology. However, the developments of technologies in aquamedicine, such as sequencing, biosensors and CRISPR, have enabled rapid disease detection within minutes. Furthermore, integrating sensors, drones, artificial intelligence and the internet in aquaculture farm monitoring has helped farmers take decisive actions to improve production. Advancements in diagnostic techniques have significantly enhanced the efficient detection of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal diseases in aquatic animals. Moreover, monitoring water quality, aquatic animal health and animal behaviour on farms has become exceptionally streamlined with cutting-edge tools like drones, sensors and artificial intelligence. Summarising research and development in aquatic animal health and monitoring aids efficient technology adoption in aquaculture. With these advanced technologies' continued development and adoption in developed countries, the aquaculture industry is experiencing growth and increased efficiency, benefiting farmers and consumers in these regions. However, farmers and educators in developing countries lack information about these technologies. Training of agricultural educators and efficient dissemination of knowledge and technologies through advertising and publication in collaboration with companies is essential. This review delves into emerging technologies capable of replacing the conventional diagnostic and monitoring methods utilised in aquaculture. We also explore their strengths, limitations and potential future applications within aquaculture settings. Innovations in technology for efficient diagnosis and monitoring of diseases and abnormality in aquaculture have significantly streamlined the process of identifying issues within the aquaculture industry, saving time and effort.image","[Bohara, Kailash; Ramena, Grace] Univ Arkansas, Dept Aquaculture & Fisheries, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA; [Joshi, Pabitra] Univ Idaho, Dept Plant Sci, Moscow, ID USA; [Acharya, Krishna Prasad] Anim Quarantine Off, Kathmandu, Nepal",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Bohara, K (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Aquaculture & Fisheries, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA.",boharak@uapb.edu,"Bohara, Kailash/GXM-8403-2022","Bohara, Kailash/0000-0002-1722-9229; Acharya, Krishna Prasad/0000-0002-4208-7592","The authors extend their gratitude to the Agriculture Extension at 1890 Land-Grant Institutions (University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff) for their support in making this publication possible, under the Federal award ID number: NI211444XXXXG014.

In order to establish the smart aquaculture service, in previous research we developed a sensor node equipped with LoRa communication module to observe several physical parameters of the aquaculture water including acidity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and temperature level. As the number of collected data growth, an integration between the WSN and cloud based computing platform is required to handle the storage and processing of those collected data. One of the challenges faced in that integration is a limited LoRa communication module which is expected to be able to send sensor data directly to the cloud platform. Therefore, a gateway device which is able to act as a bridge between sensor node devices and cloud platform is required. This research proposes the design of LoRa-MQTT gateway device for supporting the sensor-to-cloud data transmission in smart aquaculture IoT application. In its main functionality, the gateway device receives collected sensor from sensor device using LoRa communication module, build a message and transmit them to the cloud based data storage server using MQTT protocol.

It is a combination between aquaculture (farming of fish) and hydroponics (growing plants without soil), being a technique to grow plants with the aquaculture effluent. This technique claims to have high water use efficiency, does not use pesticides and reduce the use of fertilizers, which make this technology green and sustainable. Since the interest in aquaponics is increasing, the major challenge is to do it feasible and reliable at commercial scale. The concept of precision farming usually applied in the traditional farming sense is now being introduced, leading to the need to adopt sensing, smart and IoT systems for monitoring and control of its automated processes. Lately, valuable contributions have been made towards the introduction of fully and semi-automated systems in small-scale aquaponics systems by automation and manufacturing experts. This paper aims to support research towards a viable commercial aquaponics solution by identifying, listing, and providing an in-depth explanation of each of the parameters sensed in aquaponics, and the smart systems and IoT technologies in the reviewed literature. Further, the proposed review highlights potential gaps in the research literature and future contributions to be made in regards of automated aquaponics solutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Countries that have a large amount of water contribute to the needs of aquaculture production, especially the freshwater fisheries sector. Indonesia is a country that has a large number of large bodies of water and is the top-five producer of aquaculture production. Technology and engineering continue to be developed to improve the quality and quantity of aquaculture production. One aspect that can be observed is how the condition of fish pond water is healthy and supports fish growth. Various studies have been conducted related to the aquaculture monitoring system, but the problem is how effective it is in terms of accuracy of the resulting output, implementation, and costs. In this research, data fusion (DF) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) were implemented in an aquaculture monitoring system with temperature, turbidity, and pH parameters to produce valid and accurate output. The stage begins with testing sensor accuracy as part of sensor quality validation, then integrating sensors with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) so they can be accessed in real time. The implemented DF is divided into three layers: first, the signal layer consists of WSNs and their components. Second, the feature layer consists of DRL combined with deep learning (DL). Third, the decision layer determines the output of the condition of the fish pond in normal or not normal conditions. The analysis and testing of this system look at several factors, i.e., (1) the accuracy of the performance of the sensors used; (2) the performance of the models implemented; (3) the comparison of DF-DRL-based systems with rule-based algorithm systems; and (4) the cost effectiveness compared to labor costs. Of these four factors, the DF-DRL-based aquaculture monitoring system has a higher percentage value and is a low-cost alternative for an accurate aquaculture monitoring system.","[Sung, Wen-Tsai; Isa, Indra Griha Tofik] Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taichung 411030, Taiwan; [Hsiao, Sung-Jung] Takming Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Taipei 11451, Taiwan",National Chin-Yi University of Technology; Takming University Science & Technology,"Hsiao, SJ (corresponding author), Takming Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Taipei 11451, Taiwan.",sungjung@gs.takming.edu.tw,,"Isa, Indra Griha Tofik/0000-0002-7437-6751; Sung, Wen-Tsai/0000-0001-9045-9090; Hsiao, Sung-Jung/0000-0002-0723-1632",Department of Electronic Engineering at the National Chin-Yi University of Technology; National Chin-Yi University of Technology,Department of Electronic Engineering at the National Chin-Yi University of Technology; National Chin-Yi University of Technology,This research was supported by the Department of Electronic Engineering at the National Chin-Yi University of Technology.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is one promising technique to achieve precision agriculture, which is expected to greatly increase yields. However, the large-scale application of IoT systems in agriculture is facing challenges such as huge investment in agriculture IoT systems and non-tech-savvy farmers. To identify these challenges, we summarize the applications of IoT techniques in agriculture in four categories: controlled environment planting, open-field planting, livestock breeding, and aquaculture and aquaponics. The focus on implementing agriculture IoT systems is suggested to be expanded from the growth cycle to the agri-products life cycle. Meanwhile, the energy concern should be considered in the implementation of agriculture IoT systems. The construction of green IoT systems in the whole life cycle of agri-products will have great impact on farmers' interest in IoT techniques. With the life cycle framework, emerging finance, operation, and management (FOM) issues in the implementation of green IoT systems in agriculture are observed, such as IoT finance, supply chain and big data financing, network nodes recharging and repairing, and IoT data management. These FOM issues call for innovative farm production modes and new types of agribusiness enterprises.","[Ruan, Junhu; Zhao, Minjuan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Xianyang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuxuan] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Xianyang, Peoples R China; [Shi, Baofeng] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ, Xianyang, Peoples R China; [Chan, Felix Tung Sun] Hong Kong Potytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiangpei; Zhu, Fangwei] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yan] Tokai Univ, Gen Educ Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Lin, Fan] Xiamen Univ, Software Sch, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Dalian University of Technology; Tokai University; Xiamen University,"Lin, F (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Software Sch, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",rjh@nwsuaf.edu.cn; wyx19980727@126.com; f.chan@polyu.edu.hk; drhxp@dlut.edu.cn; yshi@ktmail.tokai-u.jp; iamafan@xmu.edu.cn,"jam, amir/O-6460-2019; Chan, Felix/O-8875-2016","Chan, Felix/0000-0001-7374-2396","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703122, 71531002, 71503199]; National Special Fund for Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System on Oats and Buckwheat [CARS-07-F-1]; China Ministry of Education Social Sciences and Humanities Research Youth Fund [16YJC630102]; Natural Science Basic Research Project in Shaanxi Province [2016JQ7005]; Science and Technology Plan Projects of Yangling Demonstration Zone [2016RKX-04]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018RWSK02]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University Internal Project",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Special Fund for Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System on Oats and Buckwheat; China Ministry of Education Social Sciences and Humanities Research Youth Fund; Natural Science Basic Research Project in Shaanxi Province; Science and Technology Plan Projects of Yangling Demonstration Zone; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Hong Kong Polytechnic University Internal Project(Hong Kong Polytechnic University),"This work was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 71703122, 71531002 and 71503199, the National Special Fund for Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System on Oats and Buckwheat under Grant CARS-07-F-1, China Ministry of Education Social Sciences and Humanities Research Youth Fund Project under Grant 16YJC630102, the Natural Science Basic Research Project in Shaanxi Province under Grant 2016JQ7005, Science and Technology Plan Projects of Yangling Demonstration Zone under Grant 2016RKX-04, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2018RWSK02, and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Internal Project under Grant G-UADM.",,15,87,89,15,232,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0163-6804,1558-1896,,IEEE COMMUN MAG,IEEE Commun.

This system realizes remote collection and data storage of mull-sensor processor information (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and other environmental parameters), as well as intelligent control and centralized management of breeding ponds. The system uses STM32L151C8 microcontroller and sensor terminal real-time acquisition, such as temperature, pH value, dissolved oxygen. It realizes data aggregation and transmission over a long distance to the Internet of things (IoT) telecom cloud platform through the technology of NB-IoT. The software called Keil implement the data format design of wireless communication module and data transmission. Java is used to develop background monitoring applications for accessing cloud platform, controlling underlying devices and local data processing. It can not only send hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests to monitor cloud platform data, but also issue commands to the underlying control module to control the startup and shutdown of equipment such as aerator. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou, JiangSu Province, China. The experimental results showed that the system can obtain water quality parameters in time. The temperature control accuracy is maintained at +/- 0.12 degrees C, the average relative error is 0.15 %, the dissolved oxygen control accuracy is maintained within +/- 0.55mg/L, the average relative error is 2.48 %, the pH control accuracy is maintained at +/- 0.09, and the average relative error is 0.21 %.

The mix of physical and chemical characteristics in a water sample is referred to as water quality. Mainly, water quality is critical in achieving a long-term sustainable aquaculture system. Conducting water quality parameter evaluations is crucial for executing an assessment operation and developing a more effective water resources management and planning strategy in aquaculture. The cumulative impact of water quality parameters may devastate the whole system if not managed properly. Predominantly, early diagnosis of fish illnesses and identifying the underlying causes are critical for farmers to take precautions to prevent an epidemic. Typically, fish illnesses are caused by viruses and bacteria. The presence of these pathogens may alter the pH, D.O., BOD, COD, E.C., PO43-, NO3-N, and NH3-N levels in the water. Previously, water quality was measured using handheld devices and mathematical functions. But these models fail in getting practical water quality analysis. The advances of IoT and deep learning technology adopted to aquaculture give insight analysis on the water for aquaculture. Most of the researchers working with water quality data based on one parameter and analysis with limited samples.

Among the problems is the slow response time in the care of water quality, the waste of resources and losses. The system proposed in this work monitors the water quality based on wireless sensor networks and on the Internet of Things (IoT). This information is important for the development of this area, since it allows sharing the different conditions in the breeding of aquatic organisms between different breeders and organizations.

Based on Flink, MongoDB and Kafka, we propose and implement an aquaculture monitoring system. Among them, Flink provides a high throughput, low latency processing platform for sensor data. Kafka, as a distributed publish-subscribe message system, acquires different sensor data and builds reliable pipelines for transmitting real-time data between application programs. MongoDB is suitable for storing diversified sensor data. As a highly reliable and high-performance column database, HBase is often used in sensor data storage schemes. Therefore, using real aquaculture dataset, the execution efficiency of some common operations between HBase and our solution are tested and compared. The experimental results show that the efficiency of our solution is much higher than that of HBase, which provided a feasible solution for the sensor data storage and processing of aquaculture.","[Lou, Yuansheng; Chen, Lin; Ye, Feng] Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China; [Ye, Feng; Chen, Yong] Nanjing Longyuan Microelect Co, Postdoctoral Ctr, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yong] Huaian Longyuan Agr Technol Co, Huaian 223345, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zihao] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Zhenjiang 212000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Jiangsu University of Science & Technology,"Ye, F (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China.;Ye, F (corresponding author), Nanjing Longyuan Microelect Co, Postdoctoral Ctr, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China.",yefeng1022@hhu.edu.cn,,,2018 Jiangsu Province Key Research and Development Program (Modern Agriculture) [BE2018301]; 2017 Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Research Funding Project [1701020C]; 2017 Six Talent Peaks Endorsement Project of Jiangsu [XYDXX-078],2018 Jiangsu Province Key Research and Development Program (Modern Agriculture); 2017 Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Research Funding Project; 2017 Six Talent Peaks Endorsement Project of Jiangsu,"This work is partly supported by the 2018 Jiangsu Province Key Research and Development Program (Modern Agriculture) Project under Grant No. BE2018301, 2017 Jiangsu Province Postdoctoral Research Funding Project under Grant No. 1701020C, 2017 Six Talent Peaks Endorsement Project of Jiangsu under Grant No. XYDXX-078.",,16,2,2,1,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-22744-9; 978-3-030-22743-2,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2019,11538,,,,,,648,657,,10.1007/978-3-030-22744-9_50,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-22744-9_50,,,10,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics,BQ4FD,,,,,2023-11-26,WOS:000589293800050,View Full Record in Web of Science

In most aquaculture farms, human operators are still responsible for collecting data manually and over long time intervals. In this way, management and decision-making depends on the operator's experience and can be negatively affected by human subjectivity. The application of Industry 4.0 concepts to collect and store data in real time using interconnected sensors and other automated equipment allows to increase the accuracy of the farm's operation and support faster and evidence-based decisions. This work presents an overview of some Industry 4.0-based approaches used to improve the quality, productivity and sustainability of the aquaculture industry. Initially, the Industry 4.0 definition and main concepts are presented as well as the consequences of its implementation for the improvement of general industrial processes. Following that, the current scenario of the aquaculture industry in terms of global food production and the main limitations of the sector that can be supported by intelligent systems to improve results are presented. In the next sections, specific technologies such as camera systems for animal and environmental monitoring, sensing networks and IoT to collect, transmit and store data, automated devices to support some activities and monitoring tasks, tools to support data interpretation and decision-making and modern sensing strategies for hard-to-monitor parameters are detailed. This review article shows the feasibility of using the aforementioned technologies to improve results of the aquaculture industry and, due to its advantages, it is believed that its widespread use can fill the existing gaps in this field of research in the next years.","[Biazi, Vitorino] Univ Aveiro, I3N, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; Univ Aveiro, Phys Dept, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Biazi, V (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, I3N, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",vitorino_biazi@hotmail.com,,,"Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) [2021.00667.

The correct implementation of aquaponics helps in providing healthy organic foods with low consumption of water and chemical fertilizers. Numerous research attempts have been directed toward real implementations of this technology feasibly and reliably at large commercial scales and adopting it as a new precision technology. For better management of such technology, there is an urgent need to use the Internet of things (IoT) and smart sensing systems for monitoring and controlling all operations involved in the aquaponic systems. Thence, the objective of this article is to comprehensively highlight research endeavors devoted to the utilization of automated, fully operated aquaponic systems, by discussing all related aquaponic parameters aligned with smart automation scenarios and IoT supported by some examples and research results. Furthermore, an attempt to find potential gaps in the literature and future contributions related to automated aquaponics was highlighted. In the scope of the reviewed research works in this article, it is expected that the aquaponics system supported with smart control units will become more profitable, intelligent, accurate, and effective.","[Taha, Mohamed Farag; Gouda, Mostafa; Liang, Ning; Abdalla, Alwaseela; Qiu, Zhengjun] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biosyst Engn & Food Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Taha, Mohamed Farag; Gouda, Mostafa; Liang, Ning; Abdalla, Alwaseela; Qiu, Zhengjun] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Spect Sensing, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Taha, Mohamed Farag] Arish Univ, Fac Environm Agr Sci, Dept Soil & Water Sci, North Sinai 45516, Egypt; [ElMasry, Gamal] Suez Canal Univ, Fac Agr, Agr Engn Dept, Ismailia 41522, Egypt; [Gouda, Mostafa] Natl Res Ctr, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Giza 12622, Egypt; [Zhou, Lei] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Rousseau, David] Univ Angers, Lab Angevin Rech Ingn Syst LARIS, F-49000 Angers, France; [Rousseau, David] INRAE, UMR1345 Inst Rech Hort & Semences, F-49071 Angers, France",Zhejiang University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Suez Canal University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); National Research Centre (NRC); Nanjing Forestry University; Universite d'Angers; INRAE; Universite d'Angers,"Qiu, ZJ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Biosyst Engn & Food Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.;Qiu, ZJ (corresponding author), Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Spect Sensing, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.",11813051@zju.edu.cn; gamal.masry@irta.cat; mostafa-gouda@zju.edu.cn; leizhou17@163.com; nliang@zju.edu.cn; 11613051@zju.edu.cn; david.rousseau@univ-angers.fr; zjqiu@zju.edu.cn,"Taha, Mohamed Farag/HGE-4671-2022; Zhou, Lei/HGE-4561-2022; Hassan, Alwaseela Abdalla Mohamed/AAQ-3325-2021; Gouda, Mostafa M./E-2608-2017; ElMasry, Gamal/F-3288-2015","Taha, Mohamed Farag/0000-0003-1951-1786; Zhou, Lei/0000-0001-5857-8153; Hassan, Alwaseela Abdalla Mohamed/0000-0002-1988-8746; Gouda, Mostafa M./0000-0002-8174-4145; ElMasry, Gamal/0000-0001-6586-1950",key projects of international scientific and technological innovation cooperation among governments under the national key RD plan [2019YFE0103800]; Zhejiang province key research and development program [2021C02023],key projects of international scientific and technological innovation cooperation among governments under the national key RD plan; Zhejiang province key research and development program,This research was supported by the key projects of international scientific and technological innovation cooperation among governments under the national key R&D plan (2019YFE0103800) and the Zhejiang province key research and development program (2021C02023).,,111,4,4,15,58,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-9040,,CHEMOSENSORS,Chemosensors,AUG,2022,10,8,,,,,,,303,10.3390/chemosensors10080303,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/chemosensors10080303,,,26,"Chemistry, Analytical; Electrochemistry; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Instruments & Instrumentation,4B9AU,,"Green Published, gold",,,2023-11-26,WOS:000846061300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper designs a set for an IoT-based aquaculture environment monitoring device. The device is capable of collecting five aquaculture environment factors such as water temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and light intensity throughout the day by wireless data transmission via 4G DTU with a communication success rate of 92.08%. A detection method based on time series sliding window density clustering (STW-DBSCAN) is proposed for anomaly detection, using the confidence interval distance radius of slope to extract subsequence timing features and identify the suspected abnormal subsequences and then further determine the anomalous value by the DBSCAN clustering method. The detection results show that the algorithm can accurately identify abnormal subsequences and outliers, and the accuracy, recall and F1-Score are 87.71%, 82.58% and 85.06%, respectively, which verifies the usability of the proposed method. Further, a fuzzy control algorithm is adopted to specify the warning information, and a software platform is developed based on data visualization. The platform uses WebSocket technology to interact with the server, and combined with the surveillance camera, it can monitor the aquaculture environment and perform data monitoring and analysis in a real-time, accurate and comprehensive manner, which can provide theoretical reference and technical support for sustainable development of aquaculture.","[Zhang, Hanwen; Liu, Yanwei; Gui, Fukun; Yang, Xu] Zhejiang Ocean Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Marine Aquaculture, Zhoushan 316022, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Ocean University,"Yang, X (corresponding author), Zhejiang Ocean Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Marine Aquaculture, Zhoushan 316022, Peoples R China.",2022188@zjou.edu.cn,"zhang, hanwen/JDX-0906-2023",,National Key Research and Development Project of China [2020YFE0200100]; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province [2023C02029]; Science and Technology Innovation 2025 Major Project of Ningbo City [2020Z076]; Zhoushan Science and Technology Projects [2022C01003],National Key Research and Development Project of China; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province; Science and Technology Innovation 2025 Major Project of Ningbo City; Zhoushan Science and Technology Projects,"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Project of China under grant number 2020YFE0200100, Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province under grant number 2023C02029, Science and Technology Innovation 2025 Major Project of Ningbo City under grant number 2020Z076, and Zhoushan Science and Technology Projects under grant number 2022C01003.",,38,0,0,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2023,15,7,,,,,,,5678,10.3390/su15075678,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15075678,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,D7IL4,,gold,,,2023-11-26,WOS:000970425100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Extending to the agricultural framework, in this context, different technologies are being used to diminish those environmental hazards, giving rise to the precision agriculture/aquaculture being this a management concept based on observing, measuring, and responding space/temporal variability of productions. The scope of the precision aquaculture is to apply control-engineering principles to the production, to direct farmers to a better monitoring, control, and documentation of biological processes in fish farms. The aim of this review is to show an overview (enriched by a terms mapping analysis) of the precision aquaculture engineering innovations, with some examples of commercial systems, even if most of them are not specifically addressed in the precision aquaculture framework, in terms of: computer vision for animal monitoring, environmental monitoring tools, and sensor network (i.e., wireless sensor network, and long-range), robotics, and finally data interpretation and decision tools (i.e., algorithms, Internet of Things, and Decision Support Systems). Over the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real-time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the value chain. To increase the production and ameliorate the fish product quality and animal welfare issues, it is becoming even more important to monitor and control the production process.","[Antonucci, Francesca; Costa, Corrado] Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr CREA, Ctr Ric Ingn & Trasformaz Agroalimentari, Via Pascolare 16, I-00015 Rome, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Costa, C (corresponding author), Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr CREA, Ctr Ric Ingn & Trasformaz Agroalimentari, Via Pascolare 16, I-00015 Rome, Italy.",corrado.costa@crea.gov.it,"Costa, Corrado/B-1208-2012","Costa, Corrado/0000-0003-3711-1399","sub-project Tecnologie digitali integrate per il rafforzamento sostenibile di produzioni e trasformazioni agroalimentari (AgroFiliere) (AgriDigit program) - Ministry of Agricultural, Food, Forestry and Tourism Policies (MiPAAFT) [DM 36503/7305/2018]","sub-project Tecnologie digitali integrate per il rafforzamento sostenibile di produzioni e trasformazioni agroalimentari (AgroFiliere) (AgriDigit program) - Ministry of Agricultural, Food, Forestry and Tourism Policies (MiPAAFT)","This work was supported by the sub-project Tecnologie digitali integrate per il rafforzamento sostenibile di produzioni e trasformazioni agroalimentari (AgroFiliere) (AgriDigit program) financed by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food, Forestry and Tourism Policies (MiPAAFT) (DM 36503/7305/2018).",,75,40,41,6,97,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0967-6120,1573-143X,,AQUACULT INT,Aquac.

RAS offers controlled environment which permits product growth rate control and predictable harvesting schedule. Two parameter categories need to be monitored in RAS - direct and indirect. Direct parameter like pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and some other water quality parameter exist as natural elements. The indirect parameter comes from the calcution based on stock capacity that will affect the content of these natural parameters. Extensive data acquisition and analysis will determine the success of RAS. The vast number of data will affect the network traffic especially if the system is cloud-based. Fog computing offers reduction of network traffic by providing a platform to filter and analyse the data generated by the devices. Real time decision and control also will be another advantageous in using fog technology.

Tenant aqua culture enables individuals irrespective of their profession to grow fishes locally in a little space. However, there are challenges facing aquaculture such as the availability of water, how to monitor and manage water quality, and more seriously, the problem of absence of dataset with which the farmer can use as a guide for fish breeding. Aquaponics is a system that combines conventional aquaculture with hydroponics (the method of growing plants in water i.e. soilless farming of crops). It uses these two technologies in a symbiotic combination in which the plant uses the waste from the fish as food while at the same time filtering the water for immediate reuse by the fish. This helps to solve the problem of frequent change of water. An Internet of Things (IoT) system consisting of an ESP-32 microcontroller which controls water quality sensors in aquaponics fish ponds was designed and developed for automatic data collection. The sensors include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, ammonia and nitrate sensors. The IoT system reads water quality data and uploads the same to the cloud in real time. The dataset is visualized in the cloud and downloaded for the purposes of data analytics and decision-making. We present the dataset in this paper. The dataset will be very useful to the agriculture, aquaculture, data science and machine learning communities. The insights such dataset will provide when subjected to machine learning and data analytics will be very useful to fish farmers, informing them when to change the pond water, what stocking density to apply, provide knowledge about feed conversion ratios, and in predict the growth rate and patterns of their fishes.
