The fungi are incapable of completing their life cycle in the absence of a host root. Their spores can germinate and grow in the absence of a host, but their hyphal growth is very limited. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern signalling and recognition between AM fungi and their host plants. In one of the first stages of host recognition, the hyphae of AM fungi show extensive branching in the vicinity of host roots before formation of the appressorium(2-4), the structure used to penetrate the plant root. Host roots are known to release signalling molecules that trigger hyphal branching(5-7), but these branching factors have not been isolated. Here we have isolated a branching factor from the root exudates of Lotus japonicus and used spectroscopic analysis and chemical synthesis to identify it as a strigolactone, 5-deoxy-strigol. Strigolactones are a group of sesquiterpene lactones, previously isolated as seed-germination stimulants for the parasitic weeds Striga and Orobanche(8). The natural strigolactones 5-deoxy-strigol, sorgolactone and strigol, and a synthetic analogue, GR24, induced extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the AM fungus Gigaspora margarita at very low concentrations.","Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Agr & Biol Sci, Div Appl Biol Chem, Osaka 5998531, Japan; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320112, Japan",Osaka Metropolitan University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST),"Akiyama, K (corresponding author), Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Agr & Biol Sci, Div Appl Biol Chem, Osaka 5998531, Japan.",akiyama@biochem.osakafu-u.ac.jp,"Akiyama, Kohki/B-4668-2012","Akiyama, Kohki/0000-0002-9171-9058",,,,,30,1530,1658,30,925,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",0028-0836,,,NATURE,Nature,JUN 9,2005,435,7043,,,,,824,827,,10.1038/nature03608,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature03608,,,4,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,933NK,15944706,,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000229638700052,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conversely, BCA, such as Trichoderma and Pseudomonas spp., can control disease (primary effect) but have recently demonstrated stimulation of plant growth (secondary effect) in the absence of a pathogen. Further work shedding light onto the precise mode of action and ecophysiology of these microorganisms would assist with their timely and appropriate use and potentially unleash their full promise as beneficial rhizosphere bio-inoculants for improved growth and health of plants.

The integration of these systems intensifies production in a small land area, conserves water, reduces waste discharged into the environment, and recovers nutrients from fish production into valuable vegetable crops. A standard protocol has been developed for the production of tilapia yielding 5 MT per annum. The production of many vegetable crops has also been studied but, because of specific growth patterns and differences of marketable product, no single protocol can be promoted. Each crop yields different value per unit area and this must be considered when selecting varieties to produce to provide the highest returns to the farmer. Variables influencing the value of a crop are density (plants/m(2)), yield (unit or kg), production period (weeks) and unit value ($). Combining these variables to one unit, $/m(2)/week, provides a common point for comparison among crops. Farmers can focus production efforts on the most valuable crops or continue to produce a variety of crops meeting market demand with the knowledge that each does not contribute equally to profitability.","[Bailey, Donald S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Agr Expt Stn, RR 1 Box 10 000, Kingshill, VI 00850 USA; [Ferrarezi, Rhuanito S.] Univ Florida, Indian River Res & Educ Ctr, Ft Pierce, FL 34945 USA",University of the Virgin Islands; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ferrarezi, RS (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Indian River Res & Educ Ctr, Ft Pierce, FL 34945 USA.",dbailey@uvi.edu; rferrarezi@ufl.edu,"Ferrarezi, Rhuanito Soranz/AAI-2598-2019; Ferrarezi, Rhuanito S/E-1626-2013","Ferrarezi, Rhuanito Soranz/0000-0002-6873-7995; Ferrarezi, Rhuanito S/0000-0002-6873-7995",USDA-NIFA-Hatch Funds [226104],USDA-NIFA-Hatch Funds,We thank Donna Gonzales and Luis Carino Jr. (Horticulture and Aquaculture program) for their technical assistance.

Microbes enrich plant growth through various mechanisms, such as enhancing resistance to disease and drought, producing beneficial molecules, and supplying nutrients and trace metals to the plant rhizosphere. Previous studies of PGPMs have focused primarily on soil-based crops. In contrast, aquaponics is a water-based agricultural system, in which production relies upon internal nutrient recycling to co-cultivate plants with fish. This arrangement has management benefits compared to soil-based agriculture, as system components may be designed to directly harness microbial processes that make nutrients bioavailable to plants in downstream components. However, aquaponic systems also present unique management challenges. Microbes may compete with plants for certain micronutrients, such as iron, which makes exogenous supplementation necessary, adding production cost and process complexity, and limiting profitability and system sustainability. Research on PGPMs in aquaponic systems currently lags behind traditional agricultural systems, however, it is clear that certain parallels in nutrient use and plant-microbe interactions are retained from soil-based agricultural systems.","[Bartelme, Ryan P.; Sepulveda-Villet, Osvaldo J.; Newton, Ryan J.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Freshwater Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Oyserman, Ben O.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Bioinformat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Oyserman, Ben O.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Microbial Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Blom, Jesse E.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Johns Hopkins Ctr Livable Future, Baltimore, MD USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Wageningen University & Research; Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Newton, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Freshwater Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",newtonr@uwm.edu,"sepulveda villet, osvaldo/AAD-3012-2022; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Bartelme, Ryan/0000-0002-6178-2603; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X","School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Distinguished Dissertation Fellowship","School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Distinguished Dissertation Fellowship","Funding for the work was provided by start-up laboratory funds to RN through the School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Distinguished Dissertation Fellowship to RB.",,85,44,45,4,97,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

RAS typically employ a biofilter to control ammonia levels produced as a byproduct of fish protein catabolism. Nitrosomonas (ammonia-oxidizing), Nitrospira, and Nitrobacter (nitrite-oxidizing) species are thought to be the primary nitrifiers present in RAS biofilters. We explored this assertion by characterizing the biofilter bacterial and archaeal community of a commercial scale freshwater RAS that has been in operation for >15 years. We found the biofilter community harbored a diverse array of bacterial taxa (>1000 genus-level taxon assignments) dominated by Chitinophagaceae (similar to 12%) and Acidobacteria (similar to 9%). The bacterial community exhibited significant composition shifts with changes in biofilter depth and in conjunction with operational changes across a fish rearing cycle. Archaea also were abundant, and were comprised solely of a low diversity assemblage of Thaumarchaeota (>95%), thought to be ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) from the presence of AOA ammonia monooxygenase genes. Nitrosomonas were present at all depths and time points. However, their abundance was orders of magnitude less than AOA and exhibited significant depth-time variability not observed for AOA. Phylogenetic analysis of the nitrite oxidoreductase beta subunit (nxrB) gene indicated two distinct Nitrospira populations were present, while Nitrobacter were not detected. Subsequent identification of Nitrospira ammonia monooxygenase alpha subunit genes in conjunction with the phylogenetic placement and quantification of the nxrB genotypes suggests complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox) and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira populations co-exist with relatively equivalent and stable abundances in this system. It appears RAS biofilters harbor complex microbial communities whose composition can be affected directly by typical system operations while supporting multiple ammonia oxidation lifestyles within the nitrifying consortium.","[Bartelme, Ryan P.; McLellan, Sandra L.; Newton, Ryan J.] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Sch Freshwater Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Newton, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Sch Freshwater Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",newtonr@uwm.edu,,"McLellan, Sandra/0000-0003-3283-1151; Bartelme, Ryan/0000-0002-6178-2603",University of Wisconsin System incentive grant,University of Wisconsin System incentive grant,Funding for this work was provided by a University of Wisconsin System incentive grant to the School of Freshwater Sciences and through start-up laboratory funds to RN.,,74,151,161,19,233,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-302X,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Little is known about the growth parameters of Nitrospira or the effects of environmental conditions or inhibitory compounds on Nitrospira activity. These bacterial properties were investigated using an enriched Nitrospira culture and an enriched Nitrobacter culture or Nitrobacter literature values. Compared to Nitrobacter, Nitrospira was found to have a comparable optimal PH range (8.0-8.3); similar normalised activity-temperature relationship (0.44e(0.055(T-15))) for temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C and a similar oxygen half-saturation constant, K-O (0.54 +/- 0.14 mgL(-1)). The major differences identified were that Nitrospira had a lower nitrite half-saturation constant, Ks (0.9 +/- 0.07 mgNO(2)-NL-1); lower inhibition threshold concentrations for free ammonia (between 0.04 and 0.08 mgNH(3)-N L-1) and free nitrous acid (less than 0.03 mg HNO2-N L-1) and a higher yield (0.15 +/- 0.04gVSS g N-1). Therefore, Nitrospira is more likely to dominate nitrite oxidation under conditions with low ammonium and nitrite concentrations, which would provide an advantage to them due to their lower Ks value while avoiding any free ammonia or free nitrous acid inhibition.

A recent global study found that the majority of 257 surveyed aquaponics farms made losses, but the reasons have been poorly analyzed. Based upon grey literature and a post-hoc cost-benefit analysis for an investment in an aquaponics farm in the Philippines, this paper aims to assess the factors contributing to an appropriate level of returns. In the Philippines, vegetables are relatively well-priced, but if catfish were produced, a venture producing 1250 kg fish, 6000 kg lettuce, and 300 kg tomato per year would have a Net-Benefit-Cost Ratio of below 1.3 after 20 years. This ratio should be higher when one considers the risks against which a farmer cannot and should not insure its production, as argued in the paper. Depending on the species of both fish and vegetables, the quantity of nutrients coming from the former component imposes a fish volume: vegetable area ratio ranging from 1:30 to 1:100, thus the quantity of marketable fresh vegetables determines the size of an aquaponics enterprise. As a consequence, the investments in the fish component are relatively high and weigh heavily on the financial balance.

Tripolium pannonicum (Jacq.) Dobrocz. was used to determine optimal culturing conditions for an efficient biofilter performance in terms of nutrient recycling by plant uptake. This performance was evaluated by taking different parameters into account, such as biomass production, plant nitrogen and phosphorus uptake as well as physiological parameters and decrease of nitrate-N and phosphate-P concentrations in the experimental fluid. Afterwards, additional plant species known as edible were studied to follow the idea of generating valuable co-products beside the use as biofilter. It was shown that a nitrate-N concentration of at least 10 mg l(-1) is necessary for reasonable biomass production. A phosphate-P concentration of 0.3 mg l(-1) is sufficient, but higher concentrations promote the uptake of phosphate-P. The addition of iron in chelated form is required for the growth of healthy plant biomass; the addition of manganese is beneficial but not implicitly necessary. Salt concentrations lower than seawater salinity promote biomass production and nutrient uptake. The use of a hydroponic culture system is more suitable than sand or expanded clay culture if controlled conditions and nutrient recycling are desired. The five weeks experiment to compare different halophyte species in 0.24 m(2) tanks with nine plants each resulted in above ground fresh weight of 185 to 398 g and total uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus of 0.6 to 2.1 g and 0.1 to 0.4g, respectively. All tested species have potential to serve as biofilter and source for valuable co-products. A promising application is the growth of halophytic vegetable plants in marine aquaponic systems.

The HA were characterized by elemental composition, C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (C-13 cross-polarization magic angle spinning-NMR), diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy, and high-performance size exclusion chromatography. The HA differed in hydrophobicity and molecular dimension of their alkyl, carbohydrate-like, and aromatic C components. Changes in plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity and expression in root cells were considered physiological markers of HA bioactivity. All HA promoted root growth and proton pump activation in maize vesicles. Maize plants treated for 7 days with 20 mg C HA L-1 increased adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis from 72% to 392%, and H+-ATPase expression from 111% to 495%. Within a general stimulation of root areas over control, some HA preferentially increased root length, whereas others enhanced root density. Root growth enhancement was significantly correlated to HA hydrophobicity. Although acting synergistically with hydrophobicity, the relationship to bioactivity of HA apparent molecular size and carbon content was of a lesser significance.

This has led to extensive eutrophication of fresh waters and coastal zones as well as increased inventories of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O).

Thus integrating aquaculture with agriculture, e.g. aquaponics, shows promise to enhance nutrient and water use efficiency and overall environmental sustainability. The present study was carried out to quantify a P flow, P mass balance, and evaluate P removal efficiency by hydroponic lettuce integrated with tilapia aquaculture. Also, a phosphorus dynamics simulation model was developed to be a decision support system for phosphorus management. 15 tilapia juveniles (20 g) and four 15-day-old lettuce seedlings comprised each aquaponics experimental unit (n = 3). At days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after transplanting, water samples were taken from each aquaponics biofilter to determine the reactive and total concentration of phosphorus. The P dynamics model was validated by comparing predicted to observed values of dissolved P over time. The linear regression equations between predicted and measured values were compared with the 1:1 line for statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in slope and intercept values. The adequacy of the model was determined by testing if intercept equals zero and slope equals one separately using the one sample Student t-test. Comparison of simulated and measured values of dissolved P dynamics showed a good fit around the 1:1 line with the slope (b = 1.005) and intercept values (a = 0.0189) being not statistically different (p > 0.05) from 1.0 and 0, respectively. The assimilation of Pin the fish and plant components comprised 71.7% of the total P input, indicating high P utilization by the system. The P dynamics model predicted the behavior of dissolved phosphorus in aquaponics systems, which can be used to determine adequate fish:plant ratios, maximize P use efficiency and minimize waste. The overall high P utilization by fish and plants identified in this study showed that aquaponics is an excellent tool for recycling phosphorus while yielding a high-quality crop.

The diet supplemented with phytase at the concentration of 1000 FTU kg(-1) showed a significant increase in released phosphorus compared to the control in an in vitro assay. Phytase supplementation increased accumulation of phosphorus in fish carcass compared to the control, but did not affect growth performance. The addition of phytase to fish diets improved phosphorus utilization by fish, reducing phosphorus excretion. The lower amount of phosphorus excreted in the water caused by phytase did not impair the growth or phosphorus content of lettuce grown using the aquaponic nutrient solution.

Microorganisms enhance the P availability to plants by mineralizing organic P and solubilizing precipitated phosphates. This work is focused on the effect of inoculation of a commercial product containing a mixture of Bacillus spp. on hydroponically grown lettuce (Lactuca sativa) integrated with tilapia (Orechromis niloticus) aquaculture in a closed-loop system, in comparison with an untreated control. We determined plant growth and crop quality parameters to assess the efficacy of the beneficial microorganisms. A nutrient dynamics analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of Bacillus inoculation on the changes of nutrient concentration in aquaponics solutions, as well as the phosphorus accumulation in several components (fish, plants, water and solids). We performed a plate-count assay to quantify the number microorganisms present in systems inoculated or not with the commercial Bacillus mixture. In general, nutrient dynamics was affected by the inclusion of the Bacillus mixture in the water. Systems that received the product showed faster decreases in ammonia concentration and faster increase in nitrite and nitrate concentrations than the control. The untreated aquaponics systems showed lower accumulation of phosphorus in the water than systems receiving the Bacillus mixture, which resulted in poor plant growth, low phosphorus accumulation in the leaves and low chlorophyll content. However, the mass balance analysis showed that an external source of phosphorus possibly contributed to the overall P budget in systems receiving the Bacillus mixture. The microbial plate count assay demonstrated an active microbiota in aquaponics systems receiving the treatment while untreated systems showed zero microbial counts. The Bacillus mixture used in the present study appears to have PGP properties and to affect P dynamics in aquaponics systems. However, since the product contained traces of phosphorus in its composition, further analysis will be necessary to distinguish whether the advantageous effects promoted by the Bacillus occurred as a result of a beneficial microbial activity or a fertilizing effect.

Lipoperoxidation was also estimated determining lipoxygenase activity and conjugated dienes. Tomato plants were grown under either a high (11-14%; Air treatment), a moderate (5.8-7%; Control) or a low (0.8-1.5%; Nitrogen treatment) oxygen concentration and inoculated or not with the pathogen. The high oxygen treatment resulted in a marked increase in plant growth, as measured by shoot and root weights. Root and top weights were about the same in the nitrogen-treated plants and the controls. In these treatments, plants started showing typical symptoms of root decay and infection within 6 days after inoculation with Pythium F, while highly oxygenated plants remained healthy throughout the experiment and showed a significant decrease in root colonization by the pathogen, as estimated by the immunoenzymatic staining procedure and isolation of thalles on selective medium. Nitrogen-treated plants and controls produced higher amounts of conjugated dienes and revealed increased lipoxygenase activities in comparison with highly oxygenated plants. These differences were more pronounced after inoculation with the pathogen. Our data suggest that increases in lipoxygenase activity detected in the present study in tomato roots grown under oxygen stress and inoculated with Pythium F may lead to degradation and disorganization of membrane lipids. That disorganization may facilitate root colonization by the pathogen and appearance of decay.","UNIV BRETAGNE OCCIDENTALE, ESMISAB, LAB MICROBIOL & BIOCHIM, TECHNOPLE BREST IROISE, F-29280 PLOUZANE, FRANCE; UNIV LAVAL, FAC SCI AGR & ALIMENTAT, DEPT PHYTOL, QUEBEC CITY, PQ G1K 7P4, CANADA",Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Laval University,,,,,,,,,36,82,96,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0929-1873,1573-8469,,EUR J PLANT PATHOL,Eur.

No known nitrifier carries out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly expressed during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities.","[Daims, Holger; Pjevac, Petra; Han, Ping; Herbold, Craig; Palatinszky, Marton; Vierheilig, Julia; Wagner, Michael] Univ Vienna, Div Microbial Ecol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Lebedeva, Elena V.; Bulaev, Alexandr] Russian Acad Sci, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Winogradsky Inst Microbiol, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Albertsen, Mads; Kirkegaard, Rasmus H.; Nielsen, Per H.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Ctr Microbial Communities, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Jehmlich, Nico; von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Prote, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [von Bergen, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Metabol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Rattei, Thomas] Univ Vienna, Div Computat Syst Biol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Bendinger, Bernd] Hamburg Univ Technol, DVGW Forsch Stelle TUHH, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany",University of Vienna; Russian Academy of Sciences; Research Center of Biotechnology RAS; Aalborg University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Vienna; Hamburg University of Technology,"Wagner, M (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Div Microbial Ecol, Dept Microbiol & Ecosyst Sci, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",wagner@microbial-ecology.net,"Nielsen, Per Halkjær/T-6796-2018; Han, Ping/P-5401-2019; Jehmlich, Nico/B-5403-2009; Daims, Holger/I-8410-2012; Rattei, Thomas/F-1366-2011; Han, Ping/F-2360-2017; Rattei, Thomas/AFT-1776-2022; Palatinszky, Marton/D-9876-2011; Jehmlich, Nico/D-9041-2015; Pjevac, Petra/AAW-8737-2020; Palatinszky, Márton/ABB-2723-2020; Vierheilig, Julia/AAP-2143-2020; Vierheilig, Julia/ABC-1593-2021; von Bergen, Martin/D-7960-2011; Palatinszky, Marton/HGB-7938-2022; Pjevac, Petra/ABE-9919-2021; Bulaev, Aleksandr/O-2455-2013; Wagner, Michael/A-7801-2011; Herbold, Craig William/S-4397-2018; Albertsen, Mads/T-7358-2018","Nielsen, Per Halkjær/0000-0002-6402-1877; Han, Ping/0000-0001-6025-1651; Jehmlich, Nico/0000-0002-5638-6868; Rattei, Thomas/0000-0002-0592-7791; Han, Ping/0000-0001-6025-1651; Rattei, Thomas/0000-0002-0592-7791; Palatinszky, Marton/0000-0002-3627-085X; Jehmlich, Nico/0000-0002-5638-6868; Pjevac, Petra/0000-0001-7344-302X; von Bergen, Martin/0000-0003-2732-2977; Palatinszky, Marton/0000-0002-3627-085X; Pjevac, Petra/0000-0001-7344-302X; Bulaev, Aleksandr/0000-0001-7914-9817; Wagner, Michael/0000-0002-9778-7684; Herbold, Craig William/0000-0003-3479-0197; Daims, Holger/0000-0002-4195-0913; Kirkegaard, Rasmus Hansen/0000-0003-3349-3617; Albertsen, Mads/0000-0002-6151-190X; Valeeva, Aygul V./0000-0002-9968-9586; Vierheilig, Julia/0000-0002-9764-7534","European Regional Development Funds (EFRE-Europe funds Saxony); Helmholtz Association; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27319-B21, P25231-B21]; European Research Council Advanced Grant [NITRICARE 294343]; Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF-4005-00369]; Innovation Fund Denmark (EcoDesign); Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27319] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)",European Regional Development Funds (EFRE-Europe funds Saxony); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Research Council Advanced Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); Innovation Fund Denmark (EcoDesign); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"We thank T.

The comparison between aquaponics and hydroponics has attracted considerable attention recently, particularly regarding plant yield. However, previous research has not focused on the potential of using aquaponic solution complemented with mineral elements to commercial hydroponic levels in order to increase yield. For this purpose, lettuce plants were put into AeroFlo installations and exposed to hydroponic (HP), aquaponic (AP), or complemented aquaponic (CAP) solutions. The principal finding of this research was that AP and HP treatments exhibited similar (p > 0.05) plant growth, whereas the shoot weight of the CAP treatment showed a significant (p < 0.05) growth rate increase of 39% on average compared to the HP and AP treatments. Additionally, the root weight was similar (p > 0.05) in AP and CAP treatments, and both were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that observed in the HP treatment. The results highlight the beneficial effect of recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) water on plant growth. The findings represent a further step toward developing decoupled aquaponic systems (i.e., two-or multi-loops) that have the potential to establish a more productive alternative to hydroponic systems. Microorganisms and dissolved organic matter are suspected to play an important role in RAS water for promoting plant roots and shoots growth.","[Delaide, Boris; Jijakli, M.

According the FAO, global food production can keep pace with the increase in food demand in the coming three decades. However, according the projection used here, there will be a major global increase (8%) in arable land, most of it in developing countries and with a major impact on the extent of tropical forests. Further forest clearing may occur to compensate for declining soil productivity due to land degradation. Despite improvements in the N use efficiency, total reactive N loss will grow strongly in the world's increasingly intensive agricultural systems. In the 1995-2030 period emissions of reactive N from intensive agricultural systems will continue to rise, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the increase of N use efficiency and further improvement of agronomic management must remain high on the priority list of policy makers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Fish production performance, plant growth and nutrient removal were measured and their dependence on hydraulic loading rate (HLR) was assessed. Fish production did not differ significantly between hydraulic loading rates. In contrast to the fish production, the water spinach yield was significantly higher in the lower hydraulic loading rate. Fish production, plant growth and percentage nutrient removal were highest at hydraulic loading rate of 1.28 m/day. The ratio of fish to plant production has been calculated to balance nutrient generation from fish with nutrient removal by plants and the optimum ratio was 15-42 gram of fish feed/m(2) of plant growing area. Each unit in RAS was evaluated in terms of oxygen demand. Using specified feeding regime. mass balance equations were applied to quantify the waste discharges from rearing tanks and treatment units.

The results showed that the NUE of AA was 13.79% higher than that of media-based aquaponics (MA). In addition, higher NO3- removal by microalgae assimilation led to better water quality in AA, which made up for the deficiencies of poor aquaponic management of nitrate. As a result of lower NO3- concentrations and dramatically higher dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations caused by microalgae photosynthesis in the photobioreactor, the N2O emission of AA was 89.89% lower than that of MA, although nosZ gene abundance in MA's hydroponic bed was approximately 30 times over that in AA.

In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to assess the environmental impacts of two hypothetical coupled aquaponics systems (CAPS): Raft System (RAFT) and Media-Filled Beds System (MFBS). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were considered as cultivated species in both systems. The Simapro (R) software V.8.0 was used for calculation. The comparison between the two virtual systems indicated the floating technique as the less impacting one. Even though energy consumption appears to be higher in the floating system, LCA results were markedly influenced by the extensive use of inert materials in MFSB. In both systems, contribution analyses underlined that the main environmental impacts are related to infrastructures, electricity and fish feed. The LCA analyses carried out in this study highlights that the choice of less impacting materials, and the optimization of management practices, should be taken as priorities in order to reduce environmental impacts of this activity.

Nonetheless, it is only partially understood how K+ contributes to plant productivity. K+ is used as a major active solute to maintain turgor and to drive irreversible and reversible changes in cell volume. K+ also plays an important role in numerous metabolic processes, for example, by serving as an essential cofactor of enzymes. Here, we provide evidence for an additional, previously unrecognized role of K+ in plant growth. By combining diverse experimental approaches with computational cell simulation, we show that K+ circulating in the phloem serves as a decentralized energy storage that can be used to overcome local energy limitations. Posttranslational modification of the phloem-expressed Arabidopsis K+ channel AKT2 taps this potassium battery, which then efficiently assists the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in energizing the transmembrane phloem (re) loading processes.","[Gajdanowicz, Pawel; Michard, Erwan; Sandmann, Michael; Correa, Luiz Gustavo Guedes; Gomez-Porras, Judith L.; Gonzalez, Wendy; Dreyer, Ingo] Univ Potsdam, Heisenberg Grp Biophys & Mol Plant Biol, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Michard, Erwan; Thibaud, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Montpellier 2, CNRS, UMR 5004, INRA,U386, F-34060 Montpellier 2, France; [Rocha, Marcio; Correa, Luiz Gustavo Guedes; Ramirez-Aguilar, Santiago J.; van Dongen, Joost T.] Max Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Gonzalez, Wendy] Univ Talca, Ctr Bioinformat & Simulac Mol, Talca, Chile",University of Potsdam; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Max Planck Society; Universidad de Talca,"Dreyer, I (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Heisenberg Grp Biophys & Mol Plant Biol, Inst Biochem & Biol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",dreyer@rz.uni-potsdam.de,"van Dongen, Joost/A-2345-2011; michard, erwan/GXH-1685-2022; Dreyer, Ingo/N-4747-2014; van Dongen, Joost T/F-5372-2016","Dreyer, Ingo/0000-0002-2781-0359; van Dongen, Joost T/0000-0001-7944-9289; THIBAUD, Jean-Baptiste/0000-0002-0824-6465; Michard, Erwan/0000-0001-7997-3822; Gajdanowicz, Pawel/0000-0003-3075-5992; Gonzalez, Wendy/0000-0002-7535-6883","German Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [DR 430/5-1, /5-2]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica de Chile (CONICYT); Agropolis Fondation (Reseau Thematique de Recherche Avancee Montpellier) [0803-022]",German Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica de Chile (CONICYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); Agropolis Fondation (Reseau Thematique de Recherche Avancee Montpellier),"We are grateful to M.

This freshwater recirculating system consisted of two linked sewage tanks with an intensive rearing unit (a cage) for P. punctifer placed in the first, and with a fish-plankton trophic chain replacing the filters commonly used in clear water closed systems. Detritivorous and zooplanktivorous fishes (Loricariidae and Cichlidae), maintained without external feeding in the sewage volume, mineralized organic matter and permitted the stabilization of the phytoplankton biomass. Water exchange and organic waste discharge were not necessary. In this paper we describe the processes undertaken to equilibrate this ecosystem: first the elimination of an un-adapted spiny alga, Golenkinia sp., whose proliferation was favored by the presence of a small rotifer, Trichocerca sp., and second the control of this rotifer proliferation via the introduction of two cichlid species, Acaronia nassa Heckel, 1840 and Satanoperca jurupari Heckel, 1840, in the sewage part. This favored some development of the green algae Nannochloris sp. and Chlorella sp. At that time we took the opportunity to begin a 3-month rearing test of P. punctifer. The mean specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of P. punctifer were 1.43 and 1.27, respectively, and the global FCR, including fish in the sewage part, was 1.08. This system has proven to be suitable for growing P. punctifer juveniles out to adult, and provides several practical advantages compared with traditional recirculating clear water systems, which use a combination of mechanical and biological filters and require periodic waste removal, leading to water and organic matter losses.","[Gilles, S.; Ismino, R.; Sanchez, H.; Nunez, J.; Dugue, R.; Darias, M.

Results showed that IMTA-FRS and IMTA-NFT systems achieved best average net income and thus were able to cover costs and achieve economic surplus capacity of 53% and 47% respectively. The ability of these two systems to withstand the burden of increased costs of production circumstances or take the risk of falling prices of fish and vegetables (risk reduction) was confirmed by the results. However, IMTA-FRS can be considered as a successes aquaponic model, that the period of recovery of invested capital less (2.17 vs. 3.34 year).

Several studies have tackled this problem by decoupling fish and plant systems. However, in order to achieve both high nutrient levels for the plants and low nutrient and particulate loading in the fish tanks, suspended matter in the aquaculture component needs to be discharged and fertilizer needs to be added to the plants continuously. The present study aims to explore to what degree desalination technology could potentially be used to provide the necessary balance between the two different components based on a theoretical modelling approach using contemporary source material. We suggest how specific desalination engineering approaches can improve the nutrient balances in multi-loop aquaponics systems in order to attain optimal growth conditions for both fish and plants.","[Goddek, Simon; Keesman, Karel J.] Wageningen Univ, Biobased Chem & Technol, POB 17, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Keesman, KJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Biobased Chem & Technol, POB 17, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",simon.goddek@wur.nl; karel.keesman@wur.nl,"Goddek, Simon/P-7844-2019; Keesman, Karel J/G-1769-2013","Goddek, Simon/0000-0003-4490-0230;",,,,,44,32,33,0,35,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0011-9164,1873-4464,,DESALINATION,Desalination,FEB 15,2018,428,,,,,,76,85,,10.1016/j.desal.2017.11.024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2017.11.024,,,10,"Engineering, Chemical; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Water Resources,FU1VT,,hybrid,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000423638300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

While several studies have documented the aerobic and anaerobic digestion performance of aquaculture sludge, the impact of the digestate on plant growth has yet to be understood. The present study examines the impact of either an aerobic or an anaerobic digestion effluent on lettuce plant growth, by enriching a mixture of aquaculture and tap water with supernatants from both aerobic and anaerobic batch reactors. The lettuce plants grown in the hydroponic system supplied with supernatant from an anaerobic reactor had significantly better performance with respect to weight gain than both, those in the system where supernatant from the aerobic reactor was added, as well as the control system.

Aquaponics, as a closed loop system consisting of hydroponics and aquaculture elements, could contribute to addressing these problems. However, there is a lack of quantitative research to support the development of economically feasible aquaponics systems. Although many studies have addressed some scientific aspects, there has been limited focus on commercial implementation. In this review paper, opportunities that have the potential to fill the gap between research and implementation of commercial aquaponic systems have been identified. The analysis shows that aquaponics is capable of being an important driver for the development of integrated food production systems. Arid regions suffering from water stress will particularly benefit from this technology being operated in a commercial environment.","[Goddek, Simon] Aquapon Manufaktur GmbH, D-47661 Issum, Germany; [Delaide, Boris; Jijakli, Haissam] Univ Liege, Integrated & Urban Plant Pathol Lab, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Mankasingh, Utra; Ragnarsdottir, Kristin Vala] Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Ragnarsdottir, Kristin Vala] Univ Iceland, Inst Sustainabil Studies, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Goddek, Simon; Thorarinsdottir, Ragnheidur] Univ Iceland, Civil & Environm Engn, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Liege; University of Iceland; University of Iceland; University of Iceland,"Goddek, S (corresponding author), Aquapon Manufaktur GmbH, Gelderner Str 139, D-47661 Issum, Germany.",sig97@hi.is; boris.delaide@ulg.ac.be; utra@hi.is; vala@hi.is; mh.jijakli@ulg.ac.be; rith@hi.is,"Ragnarsdottir, Kristin Vala/L-5369-2016; Goddek, Simon/P-7844-2019","Ragnarsdottir, Kristin Vala/0000-0001-6958-0734; Goddek, Simon/0000-0003-4490-0230; Delaide, Boris/0000-0001-5680-6642",EcoInnovation; Aquaponik Manufaktur GmbH; COST Action [FA1305],EcoInnovation; Aquaponik Manufaktur GmbH; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"The work was partly supported by the EcoInnovation funded project EcoPonics, by Aquaponik Manufaktur GmbH and the COST Action FA1305: The EU Aquaponics Hub-Realising Sustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU.",,121,223,234,11,526,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2015,7,4,,,,,4199,4224,,10.3390/su7044199,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su7044199,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CH0MV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2023-11-27,WOS:000353715400038,View Full Record in Web of Science

In an aquaponic RAS established in Waedenswil, Zurich, the potential of three crop plants was assessed to recycle nutrients from fish wastewater. A special design of trickling filters was used to provide nitrification of fish wastewater: Light-expanded clay aggregate (LECA) was filled in a layer of 30 cm in vegetable boxes, providing both surface for biofilm growth and cultivation area for crop plants. Aubergine, tomato and cucumber cultures were established in the LECA filter and nutrient removal rates calculated during 42-105 days. The highest nutrient removal rates by fruit harvest were achieved during tomato culture: over a period of >3 months, fruit production removed 0.52, 0.11 and 0.8 g m(-2) d(-1) for N, P and K in hydroponic and 0.43, 0.07 and 0.4 g m(-2) d(-1) for N, P and K in aquaponic. In aquaponic, 69% of nitrogen removal by the overall system could thus be converted into edible fruits. Plant yield in aquaponic was similar to conventional hydroponic production systems. The experiments showed that nutrient recycling is not a luxury reserved for rural areas with litlle space limitation; instead, the additionally occupied surface generates income by producing marketable goods. By converting nutrients into biomass, treating wastewater could become a profitable business.","[Graber, Andreas; Junge, Ranka] ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Resource Sci Gruental, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland",Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Junge, R (corresponding author), ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Resource Sci Gruental, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland.",ranka.junge@zhaw.ch,,"Junge, Ranka/0000-0002-6612-4263",,,,,29,237,256,6,363,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0011-9164,1873-4464,,DESALINATION,Desalination,SEP 30,2009,246,1-3,,,,,147,156,,10.1016/j.desal.2008.03.048,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2008.03.048,,,10,"Engineering, Chemical; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Water Resources,504RE,,,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000270634100016,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to determine (1) the nutrient value of rainbow trout farming effluents coming from two feed regimes and (2) the plant growth and disease suppressiveness effects of those fish farming effluents on tomato transplants. The effluent sludge from Skretting Orient (TM) (SO) had a higher content of P (38 vs. 32 mg L-1), K (23 vs. 11 mg L-1), N (19 vs. to 11 mg NO3 L-(1); 186 vs. 123 mg NH4 L-1), and a higher NO3:NH4 ratio (1: 9 vs. 1: 13) compared with the Martin Classic (MC), while MC was richer in Mg (42 vs. 24 mg L-1) and Ca (217 vs. 169 mg L-1). For the first trial, a stimulating effect of the fish effluent was observed on plant height, leaf area and root dry biomass, while only the root biomass was increased during the second trial. Fish sludge was rich in microorganisms (97 and 142 mu g fluorescein h(-1) mL(-1) for SO and MC, respectively) and their ability to suppress Pythium ultimum Trow and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Sacc.) Snyder & Hansen was observed. Both crude fish effluents reduced in vitro mycelial growth of P. ultimum and F. oxysporum, by 100 and 32%, respectively, whileMCeffluents showed a higher inhibition against F. oxysporum. When fish effluents were sterilized by filtration or autoclaving, lower in vitro inhibition of P. ultimum and F. oxysporum was observed. Mixed fish effluents reduced tomato plant root colonization by P. ultimum (by up to 5.7-fold) and F. oxysporum (by up to 2.1-fold). These results showed that fish effluent can be used as soil amendments to promote plant growth and increase soil suppressiveness, which in turn can prevent soil-borne diseases.","[Gravel, Valerie] Univ Laval, Dept Sols & Genie Agroalimentaire, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Dorais, Martine; Dey, Dipa] Univ Laval, Hort Res Ctr, Agr & Agri Food Canada, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Vandenberg, Grant] Univ Laval, Dept Anim Sci, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; Laval University; Laval University,"Dorais, M (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Hort Res Ctr, Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pavillon Envirotron, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",Martine.Dorais@agr.gc.ca,,,Research branch of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Research branch of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),We sincerely thank Dr. Vandenberg's laboratory for providing the fish effluents and information about the fish feed regimes as well as the technical support of Laval University.

Nitrogen application in excess of pond assimilatory capacity can lead to the deterioration of water quality through the accumulation of nitrogenous compounds (e.g., ammonia and nitrite) with toxicity to fish or shrimp. Principal sources of ammonia include fish excretion and sediment flux derived from the mineralization of organic matter and molecular diffusion from reduced sediment, although cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation and atmospheric deposition are occasionally important. Principal sinks for ammonia include phytoplankton uptake and nitrification. The magnitude of losses by ammonia volatilization and ammonium fixation to cation exchange sites is minor, but unknown. Interactions between pond sediment and water are important regulators of N biogeochemistry. Sediment represents a source of ammonia and a sink for nitrite and nitrate. The large volume of reduced sediment suggests that the potential for N removal by denitrification is high, although the magnitude of N removal by this mechanism is low because nitrification and denitrification are tightly coupled in aquatic sediments and sediment nitrification is limited by the depth of sediment oxygen penetration. Nitrogen biogeochemistry of aquaculture ponds is affected by feeds and feeding practices, water exchange and circulation, aeration, pond depth and other management procedures. Opportunities for management of N biogeochemistry are limited and goals are based largely on the intensity of fish production. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Results showed that nitrogen utilization efficiencies (NUE) of tomato-and pak choi-based aquaponic systems were 41.3% and 34.4%, respectively. The abundance of nitrifying bacteria in tomato-based aquaponics was 4.2-folds higher than that in pak choi-based aquaponics, primarily due to its higher root surface area. In addition, tomato-based aquaponics had better water quality than that of pak choi-based aquaponics. About 1.5-1.9% of nitrogen input were emitted to atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N2O) in tomato-and pak choi-based aquaponic systems, respectively, suggesting that aquaponics is a potential anthropogenic source of N2O emission.

Food production within a sustainability corridor requires innovations exceeding traditional paradigms, acknowledging the complexity arising from sustainability. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how to direct further activities, to develop technologies as potential solutions for questions related to climate change, loss of soil fertility and biodiversity, scarcity of resources, and shortage of drinking water. One approach that promises to address these problems is controlled environment agriculture. Aquaponics (AP) combines two technologies: recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) and hydroponics (plant production in water, without soil) in a closed-loop system. One challenge to the development of this technology is the conversion of the toxic ammonium produced by the fish into nitrate, via bacteria in a biofilter, to provide nitrogen to the plants. However, as this Special Issue shows, there are many other challenges that need to be addressed if the goal of the technology is to contribute to more sustainable food production systems.","[Junge, Ranka] ZHAW Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Resource Sci, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Koenig, Bettina] Humboldt Univ, Thaer Inst, IRI THESys, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Villarroel, Morris] Tech Univ Madrid, Sch Agr Engn, Ciudad Univ s-n, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Komives, Tamas] Hungarian Acad Sci, Agr Res Ctr, Inst Plant Protect, Herman Otto 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Komives, Tamas] Esterhazy Karoly Univ, Fac Agr Sci, Matrai ut 36, H-3200 Gyongyos, Hungary; [Jijakli, M.

Aquaponics uses the water from the fish to feed the plants in a totally natural way and like hydroponics, aquaponics is considered to be more sustainable as more plants can be grown per square metre compared to normal agriculture. However, as is the case with normal agriculture, in aquaponics plants are grown within horizontally. In aquaponics, using the UVI system, the ratio between fish tanks:filters:plant tanks is 2:1:5 which means that the plant tanks are occupying close to half of the production space. In order to reduce the spatial requirement for plants, which would make production even more sustainable, this research investigates aspects of combining living wall and vertical farming technologies in aquaponics. It is considered that by growing the plants vertically less space would be required. In this research living wall system is investigated but the main focus is on the potentials of using various inert substrates in the living wall systems for vertical aquaponics. The results showed that a pot system performs better in terms of management of the systems. With regard to substrates, horticultural grade coconut fibre and horticultural grade mineral wool outperformed other substrates.","[Khandaker, Mohammed; Kotzen, Benz] Univ Greenwich, Dept Architecture & Landscape, London, England",University of Greenwich,"Khandaker, M (corresponding author), Univ Greenwich, Dept Architecture & Landscape, London, England.",m.khandaker@gre.ac.uk,"Khandaker, Mohammed Abdullah Al Mamun/K-3063-2019","Khandaker, Mohammed Abdullah Al Mamun/0000-0002-8819-6591",,,,,22,15,17,3,124,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1355-557X,1365-2109,,AQUAC RES,Aquac.

The significant effect of six macro- and seven micronutrients was evaluated on the plant growth and on the fruit yield. Two experiments were performed in a nutrient film aquaponic unit. The first experiment was designed to study the effects of foliar fertilization on the seedlings of two tomato cultivars Costoluto Genovese (CG) (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and Currant tomato (Ct) (Solanum pimpinellifolium) with 8% of weekly water exchange (WE8%-RAS). The foliar fertilizer was formulated with N restriction in the last 11 weeks (TF1). In the second experiment, two other foliar fertilization treatments (TF2 and TF3) were applied with a concentration of nutrients twice and triple that in TF1, but with a lower proportion of NPK ratio. These treatments were tested on the cultivar CG in a RAS with zero water exchange (WE0%-RAS). The data from the 1st experiment showed a positive effect of the foliar fertilization on the yield of both cultivars. The fertilization markedly influenced the dry matter weight of the CG; however, this effect was not observed in the Ct. The root length of both cultivars was positively influenced by the P content, whereas the plant height was affected by the excess of Co and S. According to the results from the 2nd experiment, the TF2 plants had the highest number of fruits with a high mean weight. The system was efficient in utilizing N from fish tank; the water K favored the yield of the CG fruit and the foliar K favored the growth of the TF2 plants. With a decrease in the foliar N, the CG plants were able to absorb 27.5% of the NO3- and 7.06% of total ammonia nitrogen from water. The absolute and relative growth rate of Nile tilapia was not affected by the rate of water exchange. Fulton's condition factor of the total length and weight curve indicated that fish from WE8%-RAS had wider bodies than the fish from WE0%-RAS at the same length range. Nitrate and P in the final effluent were lower than the maximum reference values allowed for the discharged water.","[Klanian, Mariel Gullian; Diaz, Mariana Delgadillo; Aranda, Javier] Univ Marist Merida, Expt Unit, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Klanian, Mariel Gullian; Diaz, Mariana Delgadillo; Aranda, Javier; Juarez, Carolina Rosales] Univ Marist Merida, Sch Nat Resources, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico",,"Klanian, MG (corresponding author), Univ Marist Merida, Expt Unit, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico.;Klanian, MG (corresponding author), Univ Marist Merida, Sch Nat Resources, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico.",mgullian@marista.edu.mx,"Klanian, Mariel Gullian/M-1387-2015","Klanian, Mariel Gullian/0000-0003-2195-7373",University Marist of Merida,University Marist of Merida,"This study was realized by the initial financial support from the University Marist of Merida.

In principle, aquaponics, the combination of aquaculture and horticulture within a single recirculating aquaponic system (SRAPS), provides a sustainable approach; however, it has lower productivity of both fish and plants in comparison to separate recirculating systems. The aim of our new concept for aquaponics is to improve sustainability and productivity concomitant with lowering environmental emissions. The aquaponic system for (nearly) emission free tomato and fish production in greenhouses (ASTAF-PRO) is a new combination of systemic parts, consisting of 2 independent recirculating units: an aquaculture system (RAS) for fish and a hydroponic unit for plants. Both systems are connected by a 1-way valve to deliver fish water containing nutrients into the hydroponic reservoir, where the fish water can be optimized as fertilizer in order to meet specific demands of the plant species. Thus, our double recirculation aquaponic system (DRAPS) can provide optimum conditions for both parts to increase productivity and to prevent any adverse interactions between plant and fish units. Water use is minimized by condensing the plant evapo-transpired water via air conditioning and returning it into the RAS. Testing of the ASTAF-PRO prototype successfully demonstrated the principle using a combination of tilapia and tomato production. Tilapia productivity was similar to single RAS, while tomato production at least indicated the potential for similar efficiency to conventional hydroponics. Thus, ASTAF-PRO improves sustainability and productivity while lowering environmental emissions, and might promote future application of aquaponics for food security.","[Kloas, Werner; Gross, Roman; Graupner, Johannes; Monsees, Henrik; Tschirner, Martin; Wittstock, Bernd; Wuertz, Sven; Zikova, Andrea; Rennert, Bernhard] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecophysiol & Aquaculture, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Baganz, Daniela; Staaks, Georg; Suhl, Johanna] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, D-12587 Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB),"Kloas, W (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol, Dept Endocrinol, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",werner.kloas@igb-berlin.de,"Würtz, Sven/A-6550-2012; Staaks, Georg/AAR-7862-2021","Staaks, Georg/0000-0003-3516-6767; Baganz, Daniela/0000-0002-0876-9100; Monsees, Hendrik/0000-0003-2935-1106; Wuertz, Sven/0000-0002-8190-2684; Tschirner, Martin/0000-0002-7243-2756","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF) [01SF0719, 033L059, 03IO1304]; European Commission via INAPRO [619137]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Commission via INAPRO","We gratefully acknowledge funding support from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF), via grants 01SF0719, 033L059, and 03IO1304 and from the European Commission via INAPRO (grant agreement number 619137).

The daily extruded floating feed input of 1.2% (200 g) of initial fish biomass (16.7 kg) per unit equalled 12.0 g feed per kg fish or 52.5 g m(-3). Growth of O. niloticus (unit I) was better (p < 0.05) in final weight (57.4 g +/- 27.9), final biomass (27,683.3 g +/- 160.7), specific growth rate (0.70% d(-1) +/- 0.01) and feed conversion ratio (1.31 +/- 0.02) in comparison to C. carpio (unit II, 42.7 g +/- 22.2, 21,866.7 g +/- 568.6, 0.39% d(-1) +/- 0.02, 2.69 +/- 0.20). Tomato gross biomass was two times higher in combination with O. niloticus and tomato fruit weight was slightly higher. Plant growth in cucumber showed higher total fresh biomass in the C. carpio unit. Lettuce yield was near zero as a result of inter-specific competition. The Aquaponic Growth Factor (AGF), describing the growth performance of fish and plant combinations, was highest in tomato (1.12) combined with O. niloticus compared with C. carpio (0.53). However, the AGF of cucumber was slightly higher in combination with C. carpio (0.14) compared with O. niloticus (0.12). This study demonstrates best plant growth for the combination of O. niloticus with tomato and C. carpio with cucumber. The unit stocked with C. carpio had higher levels of oxygen (6.3 mg L-1 +/- 0.8) and oxygen saturation (78.6% +/- 8.4) in contrast to O. niloticus (5.8 mg L-1 +/- 0.8, 73.2% +/- 8.9). The long steady state of dissolved oxygen inside both units allowed a higher daily feed input of 0.3% of fish initial biomass during spring and summer seasons, 25% above the optimal feed input estimated for the same units during winter time (0.9% = 150 g). C. carpio extended the equilibrium phase during plant production before a significant oxygen drop occurred, beneficial for coupled aquaponics. Different growth performance of fish and plant combinations suggest multiple fish species use or polyponics (polyculture + aquaponics) in coupled aquaponics to increase plant yield. Statement of relevance: Different fish species used in identical aquaponic systems change oxygen levels and alter plant species growth. We herewith confirm this for two further fish species, and suggest combined fish species cultivation (polyponics) in coupled aquaponics to increase plant performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

To evaluate the potential of producing S. bigelovii hydroponically as a vegetable at moderate NaCl concentrations, plants were grown in nutrient solutions with 6, 8, and 10 mm NaCl, and with 200 mm NaCl as a control. Results showed that plants had a reduced main stem length, canopy width, stem diameter, and root system length in 6 to 10 mm NaCl compared with those in 200 mm. Also, fresh weight increase, fresh and dry weights of individual plants, marketable yield, and water use efficiency of the plants grown in solutions with 6 to 10 mm NaCl were significantly lower than those grown in 200 mm. Associated with the reduced growth attributes, remarkable decreases in sodium uptake by the plants were also obtained in 6 to 10 vs. 200 mm NaCl. The results suggest that S. bigelovii is not a good candidate for hydroponic production as a vegetable at moderate NaCl salinity resulting from reduced growth attributes, which are possibly associated with decreased sodium uptake.","[Zheng, Youbin] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Vineland Res & Innovat Ctr, Vineland Stn, ON, Canada",University of Guelph,"Zheng, YB (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",yzheng@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,29,22,22,2,10,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,,HORTSCIENCE,Hortscience,SEP,2014,49,9,,,,,1154,1157,,10.21273/HORTSCI.49.9.1154,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI.49.9.1154,,,4,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CD1NQ,,gold,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000350842000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This allows water to be safely recycled to the fish and results in a comparatively 'non-polluting' final effluent. As with other mariculture systems, only similar to 25% of the food-N was used for fish growth. The dominant processes affecting N within the system were excretion by fish of ammonia-N (30%), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) (30%) and faeces-N (10%), rapid transformation of DON to ammonia-N (16%) in the fish tank and uptake of ammonia-N (17 to 39%) by the seaweed (all percentages expressed relative to food input). Nitrification (10%) competed with the seaweed for the available ammonia-N. There was only minimal uptake of nitrate by the seaweed. Anoxic conditions developed in the sedimentation tank. Denitrification (5%) and bacterial ammonification, including sulphate reduction, were observed. The system showed only minor seasonality, probably because the major processes (food input and U, lactuca uptake) had only a slight dependence on temperature. Our quantitative understanding of the processes affecting N within the system was confirmed by a parallel study in which a computer simulation model was developed which was able to predict well the observed changes in ammonia-N, total oxidised N and U. lactuca growth. There was an excess of phosphorus in the food supplied. It was removed by the seaweed (9 to 21%) but to a lesser degree than ammonia-N. The residual organic matter in the sedimentation tank was enriched in P, probably because of the presence in the food of bone meal which is resistant to bacterial decay. The final effluent discharged contained 20 to 27% of the N supplied (and 39 to 47% of the P) which is less than half the N discharged from conventional mariculture technology.","NATL CTR MARICULTURE, ISRAEL OCEANOG & LIMNOL RES, IL-88112 ELAT, ISRAEL; UNIV LEEDS, DEPT EARTH SCI, LEEDS LS2 9JT, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND; N CAROLINA STATE UNIV, DEPT STAT, BIOMATH PROGRAM, RALEIGH, NC 27695 USA; HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM, FAC AGR, IL-76100 REHOVOT, ISRAEL",Israel Oceanographic & Limnological Research Institute; University of Leeds; North Carolina State University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,,,"van Rijn, Jaap/Q-5254-2017; Neori, Amir/HHM-8693-2022; Krom, Michael D/I-5076-2012","van Rijn, Jaap/0000-0002-9680-2133; Neori, Amir/0000-0002-0349-9498; Krom, Michael D/0000-0003-3386-9215",,,,,43,92,103,0,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

The Murray Cod had FCR's and biomass gains that were statistically identical in all systems. Lettuce yields were good, and in terms of biomass gain and yield, followed the relationship Gravel bed > Floating > NFT, with significant differences seen between all treatments. The NFT treatment was significantly less efficient than the other two treatments in terms of nitrate removal (20% less efficient), whilst no significant difference was seen between any test treatments in terms of phosphate removal. In terms of dissolved oxygen, water replacement and conductivity, no significant differences were observed between any test treatments. Overall, results suggest that NFT hydroponic sub-systems are less efficient at both removing nutrients from fish culture water and producing plant biomass or yield than Gravel bed or Floating hydroponic sub-systems in an Aquaponic context. Aquaponic system designers need to take these differences into account when designing hydroponic components within aquaponic systems.","RMIT Univ, Dept Biotechnol & Environm Biol, Sch Appl Sci, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Lennard, WA (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Dept Biotechnol & Environm Biol, Sch Appl Sci, Bldg 223,Level 1,Plenty Rd 71, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia.",S8702774@student.rmit.edu.au,,,,,,,23,145,158,4,226,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0967-6120,1573-143X,,AQUACULT INT,Aquac.

There is growing interest in aquaponics because it can be practiced in non-traditional locations for agriculture such as inside warehouses and on marginal lands, and it can provide locally grown products without using synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, or antibiotics. Yet questions remain about the ecological and economic sustainability of aquaponics. The objective of this study was to describe the operating conditions, inputs (energy, water, and fish feed) and outputs (edible crops and fish) and their relationship over two years for a small-scale raft aquaponics operation in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The system had roughly 1% water loss per day and used an average of 35,950 L for replenishment per year. Predicted values suggest rainfall could completely replace the existing water needs. The average energy use was 19,526 kWh for propane and electricity per year at a cost of $2055 US dollars. The largest uses of electricity were in-tank water heaters. Comparing inputs to outputs, 104 L of water, 0.5 kg feed, and 56 kWh energy ($6 in energy costs) were needed to produce 1 kg of crops; and 292 L of water, 1.3 kg feed, and 159 kWh of energy ($12 in energy costs) were needed to produce a 1 kg increase in tilapia. Raising tilapia was a net loss, while raising crops was a net gain when comparing market prices to energy costs. Understanding energy, water, and feed use in aquaponic systems is essential to inform farm business plans. These data can serve as a point of comparison to other small-scale aquaponic systems, and inform future work on life cycle assessments of aquaponics. (C) 2015 The Authors.

There is expanding interest in aquaponics as a form of aquaculture that can be used to produce food closer to urban centers. Commercial aquaponics uses methods and equipment from both the hydroponics and aquaculture industries. There have been few studies of commercial-scale aquaponics production, and the purpose of this research was to document the production methods, crop and fish yields, and profitability of commercial aquaponics in the United States (US) and internationally. An online survey was used for data collection, and 257 respondents met the inclusion criteria for the study. Eighty-one percent of respondents lived in the US, and the remaining respondents were from 22 other countries. The median year that respondents had begun practicing aquaponics was 2010. A total of 538 full-time workers, 242 part-time workers, and 1720 unpaid workers or volunteers were employed at surveyed organizations. The most commonly raised aquatic animals by percent were tilapia (69%), ornamental fish (43%), catfish (25%), other aquatic animals (18%), perch (16%), bluegill (15%), trout (10%), and bass (7%). Production statistics, gross sales revenue, investments, and sales outlets for operations are reported and compared to other fields of aquaculture and agriculture. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to study which factors were associated with profitability (as a binary outcome) in the past 12 months. Several factors were significantly associated with profitability: aquaponics as the respondents' primary source of income (p < 0.01; Odds Ratio: 5.79; 95% Confidence Interval: 3.8-9.0), location in US Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 7-13 (p < 0.01; OR: 4.17; 95% CI: 3.2-5.5), gross sales revenue >=$5000 (p < 0.01; OR: 3.58; 95% CI: 2.2-5.8), greater aquaponics knowledge (p < 0.01; OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 2.0-2.9), and sales of non-food products (e. g., supplies, materials, consulting services, workshops, and agrotourism) (p = 0.028; OR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.1-4.2). Our survey findings provide a better understanding of the business of aquaponics, which may enhance future commercial operations. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to document and analyze the production methods, experiences, motivations, and demographics of aquaponics practitioners in the United States (US) and internationally. The survey was distributed online using a chain sampling method that relied on referrals from initial respondents, with 809 respondents meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority of respondents were from the US (80%), male (78%), and had at least a high school degree (91%). The mean age of respondents was 47613 years old. Most respondents (52%) had three years or less of aquaponics experience. Respondents typically raised tilapia or ornamental fish and a variety of leafy green vegetables, herbs, and fruiting crops. Respondents were most often motivated to become involved in aquaponics to grow their own food, for environmental sustainability reasons, and for personal health reasons. Many respondents employed more than one method to raise crops, and used alternative or environmentally sustainable sources of energy, water, and fish feed. In general, our findings suggest that aquaponics is a dynamic and rapidly growing field with participants who are actively experimenting with and adopting new technologies. Additional research and outreach is needed to evaluate and communicate best practices within the field. This survey is the first large-scale effort to track aquaponics in the US and provides information that can better inform policy, research, and education efforts regarding aquaponics as it matures and possibly evolves into a mainstream form of agriculture.","[Love, David C.; Fry, Jillian P.; Genello, Laura] Johns Hopkins Univ, Johns Hopkins Ctr Livable Future, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Love, David C.; Fry, Jillian P.; Genello, Laura] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Hill, Elizabeth S.] Univ Maryland Extens, Baltimore, MD USA; [Frederick, J.

This issue has raised public interest in exploring environmental friendly sustainable practices. In this study, three strains of Azospirillum brasilense (Sp7, Sp7-S and Sp245) were evaluated for their impacts on the growth of lettuce seedlings grown with fish effluent (FE) as a source of nutrients. Lettuce seeds were inoculated with these strains before sowing and at transplanting, and grown under greenhouse condition with natural light. Despite the existing indigenous microflora and low level of nutrients in the FE, the A. brasilense strains survived at populations ranging from 5 to 6cfug(-1) of roots and altered important agronomic traits, which led to growth enhancement. In particular, inoculated seedlings showed significant increase in the number of leaves, seedling height and root length. Chlorophyll and protein content were also improved, but only with Sp7 strain. However, the expression of pathogenesis-related protein, i.e., peroxidase, and level of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid increased by more than 50% in response to inoculation with the strains. Azospirillum inoculation also showed little or no adverse impact on the FE bacterial community indicating that it can be incorporated into a system that uses FE as a nutrient source, e.g., aquaponics. Thus, A. brasilense could be a valuable agent to help maximize the usefulness of FE or wastewater from freshwater aquaculture to further support plant growth.","[Mangmang, Jonathan S.; Deaker, Rosalind; Rogers, Gordon] Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia",University of Sydney,"Mangmang, JS (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Agr & Environm, Biomed Bldg,Australian Technol Pk,1 Cent Ave, Eveleigh, NSW 2015, Australia.",jsm_yan@yahoo.com,"Deaker, Rosalind J/I-4302-2012; Rogers, Gordon S/G-5533-2011","Deaker, Rosalind/0000-0001-8343-8574",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research - John Alwright Fellowship (ACIAR-JAF),Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research - John Alwright Fellowship (ACIAR-JAF)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res),The authors wish to thank Dr Joy Becker for providing us the fish effluent and Applied Horticultural Research (AHR) for the transport and other logistic supports.

The set up included four different experimental combinations that were periodically monitored for 5 months. After this period, polychaete-assisted sand filters reduced in 70% the percentage of OM and the average densities increased from approximate to 400 ind.m(-2) to 7000 ind.m(-2). H. portulacoides in aquaponics contributed to an average DIN (Dissolved inorganic Nitrogen) decrease of 65%, which increased to 67% when preceded by filter tanks stocked with polychaetes. From May until October (5 months) halophytes biomass increased from 1.4 kg m(-2) +/- 0.7 (initial wet weight) to 18.6 kg m(-2) +/- 4.0. Bearing in mind that the uptake of carbon is mostly via photosynthesis and not though the uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon, this represents an approximate incorporation of approximate to 1.3 kg m(-2) carbon (C), approximate to 15 g m(-2) nitrogen (N) and approximate to 8 g m(-2) phosphorus (P) in the aerial part (76% of total biomass), and an approximate incorporation of approximate to 0.5 kg m(-2) carbon (C), approximate to 3 g m(-2) nitrogen (N) and approximate to 2 g m(-2) phosphorus (P) in the roots (24% of total biomass). In the present study, the potential of the two extractive species for biomitigation of a super-intensive marine fish farm effluent could be clearly demonstrated, contributing in this way to potentiate the implementation of more sustainable practices.

Three methods, probit analysis, Spearman-Karber and a linear regression model, were used to calculate LC50 concentrations. For all three heavy metals, the LC50 concentrations were higher for fingerlings than for fry. Copper was more toxic than lead and iron to both life stages. The species sensitivity distributions of O. mossambicus, as well as those of freshwater fish species from the ECOTOX database and literature, were closely predicted by the models for all three metals. The sensitivity of O. mossambicus to copper, iron and lead varied significantly. The early life stages of Oreochromis mossambicus were less sensitive to copper and lead than most freshwater fish species. The HC5 concentrations that can be used as guidelines to protect 95% of freshwater fish species in similar environments to O. mossambicus were determined as being <0.001, <0.17 and <0.96 mg l(-1) for copper, lead and iron, respectively. Although there are limited data on heavy metals, the toxicity data generated in this study can be applied in risk assessments for local freshwater species in the rivers of Limpopo province.","[Mashifane, T.

The hydroponic component of the AP directly influences water quality (in turn influencing fish growth and health), and water consumption (through evapotranspiration) of the entire system. In order to assess the role of the design and the management of the hydroponic component on the overall performance, and water consumption of the aquaponics, 122 papers published from 1979 to 2017 were reviewed. Although no unequivocal results were found, the nutrient film technique appears in several aspects less efficient than medium-based or floating raft hydroponics. The best system performance in terms of fish and plant growth, and the highest nutrient removal from water was achieved at water flow between 0.8 L min(-1) and 8.0 L min(-1). Data on water consumption of aquaponics are scarce, and no correlation between the ratio of hydroponic unit surface/fish tank volume and the system water loss was found. However, daily water loss was positively correlated with the hydroponic surface/fish tank volume ratio if the same experimental conditions and/or systems were compared. The plant species grown in hydroponics influenced the daily water loss in aquaponics, whereas no effect was exerted by the water flow (reciprocating flood/drain cycle or constant flow) or type (medium-based, floating or nutrient film technique) of hydroponics.","[Maucieri, Carmelo; Nicoletto, Carlo; Sambo, Paolo; Borin, Maurizio] Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm, Agripolis Campus,Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy; [Maucieri, Carmelo; Junge, Ranka; Schmautz, Zala] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Ecol Engn, Inst Nat Resource Sci, Wadenswil, Switzerland",University of Padua; Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Maucieri, C (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm, Agripolis Campus,Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",carmelo.maucieri@unipd.it,"Schmautz, Zala/AAV-5750-2020; sambo, Paolo/B-6742-2014; borin, maurizio/AAY-1399-2021; Maucieri, Carmelo/ABF-4069-2020","Schmautz, Zala/0000-0003-0672-7086; sambo, Paolo/0000-0003-4348-8838; Maucieri, Carmelo/0000-0003-4004-6612; Junge, Ranka/0000-0002-6612-4263; borin, maurizio/0000-0002-4074-2098","Cost Action The EU Aquaponics Hub [FA1305]; Realising Sustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU [COSTSTSM-ECOST-STSM-FA1305-011016-080268]; Department of Agronomy, Food, Natural resources, Animals and Environment research","Cost Action The EU Aquaponics Hub; Realising Sustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU; Department of Agronomy, Food, Natural resources, Animals and Environment research","The work of Carmelo Maucieri was supported by Cost Action FA1305 The EU Aquaponics Hub; Realising Sustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU grant COSTSTSM-ECOST-STSM-FA1305-011016-080268 and by a Department of Agronomy, Food, Natural resources, Animals and Environment research grant Aquaponic - Sustainable management of aquaculture effluent as an unconventional source for irrigation and fertilisation of crops.",,122,54,58,11,72,PAGEPRESS PUBL,PAVIA,"MEDITGROUP, VIA G BELLI, 4, PAVIA, 27100, ITALY",1125-4718,2039-6805,,ITAL J AGRON,Ital.

Hybrid tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus x O. niloticus L. were grown in tanks associated with biofilters (sand beds) in which tomatoes Lycopersicon esculentum were grown. The effect of four biofilter volume (BFV)/fish rearing tank volume ratios (0.67/1, 1.00/1, 1.50/1, 2.25/1) on water use efficiency was evaluated. 'Laura' (first experiment) or 'Kewalo' tomatoes were grown 4/m(2) in biofilters of four different sizes and surface-irrigated 8 times daily with water from the associated fish tanks. Daily water consumption increased with BFV/tank ratios and with time. Fish production rates increased with biofilter volume in the first experiment, but were not significantly different in the second experiment. Total tomato fruit yield per plot increased from 13.7 to 31.7 kg (Experiment 1) and from 19.9 to 33.1 kg (Experiment 2) with increasing BFV/tank ratio. For fish plus fruit, total energy production increased from 4,950 to 8,963 kcal/plot and from 4,804 to 7,424 kcal/plot in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, and protein production increased from 536 to 794 and from 352 to 483 g/plot in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, with increasing BFV/tank ratio. Trends in water use efficiency for production of food energy (kcal/L) and of protein (gn) in tomatoes and fish were complex. Water use efficiency for total energy production (fish plus fruit) did not significantly differ with biofilter volume. Economy of water use for total protein production (fish plus fruit) decreased significantly with increasing BFV/tank ratio. The component ratios of the system may be manipulated to favor fish or vegetable production according to local market trends or dietary needs, and thus may have economic potential in areas of limited water supply and high demand for quality food.","IAV Syst, W Augusta, VA 24485 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; N Carolina State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Kansas State Univ, Dept Agron, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; Kansas State University,"Cure, JD (corresponding author), IAV Syst, HC60,Box 31, W Augusta, VA 24485 USA.",,,,,,,,19,46,51,0,25,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0893-8849,,,J WORLD AQUACULT SOC,J.

The main focus has been on solving technology issues and optimizing production. However, increasing attention is now being paid to certification and regulations linked to aquaponics, as well as the marketing of products and services. The paper presents the results of a study whose main aim was to estimate consumers' knowledge about aquaponics and their acceptance of aquaponics products in different European regions. An on-line questionnaire was administered to the general public through the aquaponics network of Food and Agriculture COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action FA1305 The EU Aquaponics HubRealising Sustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU in 16 European countries. The methodology includes univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. The results show that, on average, attitudes towards aquaponics were positive, showing no significant differences between those who already knew about aquaponics and those who only heard about it through the survey. More than 50% of respondents had never heard of aquaponics, whilst more than 70% had already heard of hydroponics. No more than 17% of respondents were willing to pay more for aquaponically produced products and no more than 40% more when compared to the price of products from conventional farming. The results confirm three different clusters of potential consumers of aquaponics products. They also suggest an urgent need for implementing integrated and holistic approaches involving all stakeholders in aquaponics, in order to define a marketing plan and efficient communication strategies. This COST action, other projects and public decision makers must invest in educating consumers about aquaponics through the organization of guided tours, thematic workshops and tastings of aquaponics products in order to raise their awareness about this new technology. It is absolutely urgent that public decision makers, in cooperation with aquaponics stakeholders, address the main institutional constraints, namely the introduction of aquaponics as an economic activity and the organic certification of aquaponics products.","[Milicic, Vesna] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Thorarinsdottir, Ragnheidur] Univ Iceland, Hjardarhaga 2-6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Dos Santos, Maria] IPL, ESCS, IUL, DINAMIACET,ISCTE, Ave Forcas Armadas,Sala 2W4-d, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Hancic, Maja Turnsek] Univ Maribor, Fac Tourism, Cesta Prvih Borcev 36, SI-8250 Brezice, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Iceland; Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; University of Maribor,"Milicic, V (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Jamnikarjeva 101, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",vesna.milicic@bf.uni-lj.si; rith@hi.is; mjpls1963@iscte.pt; maja.turnsek@um.si,"Dos-Santos, Maria José Palma Lampreia/I-6292-2019; Turnsek, Maja/AAG-9112-2019","Dos-Santos, Maria José Palma Lampreia/0000-0002-1992-0419; Turnsek, Maja/0000-0001-9367-9427; Thorarinsdottir, Ragnheidur/0000-0002-2490-1781",COST [FA1305],COST(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"Translation of the questionnaire was provided by Maria Jose Dos-Santos (DINAMIA'CET-ISCTE-IUL and ESCS, Portugal), Elena Mante and Dora Koutsogaki (University of Thessaly, Greece) and Saskia Buysesns (PCG, Belgium).

Scientifically, the first studies regarding soilless cultures were carried on by Francis Bacon who published Sylva Sylvarum in 1627. Intrigued by his discoveries, Justus von Liebing elaborated the mineral theory of plant nutrition in 1842, John Woodward added soil particles to water in 1699, De Saussure noted in 1804 that pants are made of compounds that are also found in water and air, and Justus von Liebing published in 1842 a list of elements essential for plant growth. Starting with 1842, research in hydroponics continued until 1980 when Mark McMurtry managed to achieve the first aquaponic organic hydroponics system; in 2004, they acknowledged the superiority of this type of culture. At present, aquaponic organic hydroponics meets the most diverse requirements; it can be met in deserted areas, in areas with severe ecological accidents and in intensive or small-size cultures. In this study, the authors analyse substratum culture and floating shelves culture for small areas to show the advantages of each system from the perspective of setting costs and of system maintenance. Thus, we can see that the floating shelves system is neatly superior since it requires small funds for setting and maintenance; the substratum system is better only from the perspective of plant distance and plant size because substratum provides plants with increased stability.","Banat's University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine King Michael the 1st of Romania from Timisoara, Faculty of Horticulture and Forestry, Timisoara, Romania.",,,,,,,,,,,5,6,0,1,Universitatea de Stiinte Agricole si Medicina Veterinara a Banatului Timisoara,,Timisoara,2066-1797,,,,,,2015,19,3,,,,,73,76,,,,,,4,AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS POLICY; ECONOMICS; PLANT SCIENCES; AGRICULTURE MULTIDISCIPLINARY,???database.CABI.ABSTRACTS.full???,Agriculture; Business & Economics; Plant Sciences,,,,,,2023-11-27,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently presented decoupled aquaponics (2-loop systems) have been awarded for eliminating major bottlenecks. In a pilot study, production in an innovative decoupled aquaponic system was compared with a coupled system and, as a control, a conventional RAS, assessing growth parameters of fish (FCR, SGR) and plants over an experimental period of 5 months. Soluble nutrients (NO3--N, NO2--N, NH4+-N, PO43-, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl2- and Fe2+), elemental composition of plants, fish and sludge (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, C), abiotic factors (temperature, pH, oxygen, and conductivity), fertilizer and water consumption were determined. Fruit yield was 36% higher in decoupled aquaponics and pH and fertilizer management was more effective, whereas fish production was comparable in both systems. The results of this pilot study clearly illustrate the main advantages of decoupled, two-loop aquaponics and demonstrate how bottlenecks commonly encountered in coupled aquaponics can be managed to promote application in aquaculture.","[Monsees, Hendrik; Kloas, Werner; Wuertz, Sven] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Biol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany; [Monsees, Hendrik; Kloas, Werner; Wuertz, Sven] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Humboldt University of Berlin,"Monsees, H (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Biol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany.;Monsees, H (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany.",h.monsees@igb-berlin.de,"Würtz, Sven/A-6550-2012","Monsees, Hendrik/0000-0003-2935-1106; Wuertz, Sven/0000-0002-8190-2684",Elsa-Neumann Scholarship; EU Aquaponics Hub COST action network [FA1305],Elsa-Neumann Scholarship; EU Aquaponics Hub COST action network,"This work received support from the Elsa-Neumann Scholarship - HM recieved his payment for his PhD through the Elsa-Neumann Scholarship. https://www.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/szf/wiss_nachwuchs/wn_natoeg_html.

Still, in most traditional RAS, this sludge is discharged directly or following dewatering. Here, the potential recycling of nutrients from sludge is assessed, comparing aerobic and anaerobic mobilization of nutrients experimentally, ultimately aiming at an application in aquaponic systems. Nutrient mobilization processes were studied, monitoring soluble nutrients photometrically in the treatment tanks (NO3--N, NO2--N, total ammonia nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP], K+, Mg2+ and Fe2+), the nutrient composition of the sludge (total phosphorus, Fe, Mn, Al, S, Mg, Ca) by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, as well as C: N ratio, total solids (TS) and total suspended solids (TSS). Aerobic treatment (aerated, AT) resulted in a 3.2-fold increase in mean (+/- SD) SRP from 9.4 (+/- 0.7) to 29.7 (+/- 2.1) mg l(-1), most likely owing to a decrease in pH. In contrast, in the anaerobic treatment (unaerated, UT), SRP remained unchanged between 9.4 (+/- 0.7) and 9.3 (+/- 0.4) mg l(-1). Both treatments resulted in increased K+ concentrations from 28.1 (+/- 1.5) to 36.8 (+/- 2.3) mg l(-1) in AT and to 32.2 (+/- 2.3) mg l(-1) in UT. AT revealed best mobilization of P and K+ without major losses of NO3--N.

European sea bass juveniles (Dicentrarchus labrax) weighing 20 +/- 0.5 g were divided in three aquaponics systems: CTRL, reared at 20 ppt salinity; AFI, reared in freshwater (0 ppt) and infected with the dinoflagellate Amyloodinium ocellatum; ASI, reared at 20 ppt salinity and infected with A. ocellatum. Beta vulgaris plants were introduced in each of the aquaponic systems. Temperature was increased 1 degrees C every second day from 18 to 25 degrees C during the experiment. At the end of the trial, liver, brain, intestine and gills were sampled for molecular and histological analyses. A. ocellatum affected D. labrax growth (insulin-like growth factor I, IGF-I) and appetite (Neuropeptide Y, NPY) signals in ASI. Immune system was activated in ASI by the presence of parasites by producing higher levels of Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), codifying for a protein involved in lipid metabolism, was upregulated in ASI because of the necessity to produce energy to maintain homeostasis.

The use of phosphate minerals and their products as fertilizers has increased tremendously global food production; it would not be possible to feed the current world population without phosphate fertilizers. Yet phosphate is a limited global resource; current estimates suggest economic phosphorus supply may be severely depleted over the next 100 years.

Each system contained 3.7 m3 water, and the relationship of the water volume in the aquaculture tank to the settling basin (sedimenter), the biofilter and the hydroponic units was 2.25:1:0.075:0.6 (fish tank:hydroponic unit=3.75), with a daily water input of 5.77% (0.20) and a water removal rate of 1.37% (0.04) per day. The experiment was divided into three sub-experiments (49 days SE I, 56 days SE II, 55 days SE III), characterized by increasing mean (24.85 g (0.36)) and total (1,217.50 g (17.68)) feed input levels in SE I, 131.12 g (4.99) and 7,342.50 g (279.31) in SE II, and 221.72 g (8.78) and 11,751.00 g (465.28) in SE III, respectively. Sub-experiment I was the run-in phase, characterized by low nutrient loads, fish and plant weights. This phase showed increasing values of oxygen, phosphate, salinity and conductivity. SE II was the exponential phase, with increasing feed input, fish and plant weights, until a distinct drop in oxygen levels occurred, and increasing conductivity, salinity and nutrient loads. SE III was the steady phase, where the feed input of 200 g day-1 balanced the oxygen level, salinity, conductivity and nutrient load, with a water input of 6.53% (0.02) and a lower removal rate of 1.23% (0.00) per day. Nile tilapia fry (Oreochromis niloticus) of 0.50 g initial weight resulted in an individual fish weight gain of 60.93 g (28.95), a specific growth ratio (SGR) of 3.04% d-1 (0.34), 24.25 kg of biomass weight gain and a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 0.83 in system I, and a non-significant weight gain (p<0.05) of 51.29 g (16.20), an SGR of 2.98% d-1 (0.21), 20.42 kg of biomass weight gain and an FCR of 0.93 in system II. The overall yield of tomato biomass was 20.03 kg. In this communication, we describe our experimental ebb-flow aquaponic system to demonstrate the influence of system design on the chemophysical parameters, system stability, and fish and plant growth. The importance of other, as yet untested, parameters that may influence economic sustainability, e.g. feed design, fish welfare, parasite and pathogen control, fish physiology, fish/plant combinations and product quality, are discussed.","University of Rostock, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Aquaculture and Sea-Ranching, Justus-von-Liebig-Weg 6, D-18059 Rostock, Germany.",,,,,"Knaus, Ulrich/0000-0002-8496-4864",,,,,,18,18,0,15,Bioflux,,Cluj-Napoca,1844-8143,,,,,,2014,7,1,,,,,20,32,,,,,,13,ECONOMICS; FISHERIES; INFECTIOUS DISEASES; VETERINARY SCIENCES; MARINE FRESHWATER BIOLOGY; ECOLOGY,???database.CABI.ABSTRACTS.full???,Business & Economics; Fisheries; Infectious Diseases; Veterinary Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,2023-11-27,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Starting from small-scale operations, aquaponics is at the brink of commercialization, attracting investment. Arising from integrated freshwater aquaculture, a variety of methods and system designs has developed that focus either on fish or plant production. Public interest in aquaponics has increased dramatically in recent years, in line with the trend towards more integrated value chains, greater productivity and less harmful environmental impact compared to other production systems. New business models are opening up, with new customers and markets, and with this expansion comes the potential for confusion, misunderstanding and deception. New stakeholders require guidelines and detail concerning the different system designs and their potentials. We provide a definitive definition of aquaponics, where the majority (> 50%) of nutrients sustaining the optimal plant growth derives from waste originating from feeding aquatic organisms, classify the available integrated aquaculture and aquaponics (open, domestic, demonstration, commercial) systems and designs, distinguish four different scales of production (<= 50, > 50-<= 100 m(2), > 100-<= 500 m(2), > 500 m(2)) and present a definite nomenclature for aquaponics and aquaponic farming allowing distinctions between the technologies that are in use. This enables authorities, customers, producers and all other stakeholders to distinguish between the various systems, to better understand their potentials and constraints and to set priorities for business and regulations in order to transition RAS or already integrated aquaculture into commercial aquaponic systems.","[Palm, Harry W.; Knaus, Ulrich; Strauch, Sebastian M.] Univ Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Aquaculture & Sea Ranching, Justus von Liebig Weg 6, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Appelbaum, Samuel] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, French Associates Inst Agr & Biotechnol Drylands, Sede Boqer Campus, IL-8499000 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Goddek, Simon] Wageningen Univ, Biobased Chem & Technol, POB 17, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Tycho] Safi Sana, Stn Pl 30,1382 AD,POB 5064, NL-1380 GB Weesp, Netherlands; [Jijakli, M.

The research, carried out at the Experimental Farm of the University of Tuscia, compared summer yields of two romaine lettuce crops (Lactuca sativa L. 'Integral') grown on aquaponic and hydroponic floating systems. For the hydroponic treatment a nutritive solution of 1.7 dS m(-1) and pH 5.5 supported plant growth. For the aquaponic system two treatments under different fish densities supplied nutrients at different concentrations. Every aquaponic treatment consisted of 3 independent 250-L tanks stocked with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.). Each fish tank fed a 1.5 m(2) floating system under a 20 plant m(-2) density. For the first crop 110 g and 24 g tilapia were stocked at system setup respectively under a low (5 kg m(-3)) and high (8 kg m(-3)) density and supplied nutrients with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.4 and 0.6 dS m(-1). For the second crop 168 g and 90 g tilapia respectively stocked under a low (6 kg m(-3)) and high (20 kg m(-3)) stocking density raised EC levels to 0.5 and 1.0 dS m(-1). Production of 2.8 kg m(-2) from the first hydroponic crop was similar to the 2.7 kg m(-2) assessed in the high density aquaponic treatment. Conversely the 2.3 kg m(-2) measured in the low density treatment was smaller. For the second trial no differences were noticed between the 6.0 kg m(-2) measured in the hydroponic system and the 5.7 and 5.6 kg m(-2) assessed in the high and low-density aquaponic treatments, respectively.

Providing plants with an accessible form of iron is crucial when it is scant or unavailable in soils. Chemical chelates are the only current alternative and are highly stable in soils, therefore, posing a threat to drinking water. The aim of this investigation was to quantify siderophores produced by two bacterial strains and to determine if these bacterial siderophores would palliate chlorotic symptoms of iron-starved tomato plants. For this purpose, siderophore production in MM9 medium by two selected bacterial strains was quantified, and the best was used for biological assay. Bacterial culture media free of bacteria (S) and with bacterial cells (BS), both supplemented with Fe were delivered to 12-week-old plants grown under iron starvation in hydroponic conditions; controls with full Hoagland solution, iron-free Hoagland solution and water were also conducted. Treatments were applied twice along the experiment, with a week in between. At harvest, plant yield, chlorophyll content and nutritional status in leaves were measured. Both the bacterial siderophore treatments significantly increased plant yield, chlorophyll and iron content over the positive controls with full Hoagland solution, indicating that siderophores are effective in providing Fe to the plant, either with or without the presence of bacteria. In summary, siderophores from strain Chryseobacterium C138 are effective in supplying Fe to iron-starved tomato plants by the roots, either with or without the presence of bacteria. Based on the amount of siderophores produced, an effective and economically feasible organic Fe chelator could be developed.","[Radzki, W.] Life Sci Univ Lublin, Dept Fruits Vegetables & Mushrooms Technol, Fac Food Sci & Biotechnol, PL-20704 Lublin, Poland; [Radzki, W.; Gutierrez Manero, F.

The objectives were to determine the production of tilapia and basil using batch and staggered cropping systems, compare aquaponics with field crop production and evaluate the ratio of feed input to plant growing area. The projected annual production of tilapia was 4.37 t. The mean yield of basil was 2.0, 1.8 and 0.6 kg/m(2) using batch, staggered and field cropping systems, respectively.

Common carp was stocked in the rearing tanks at 50 fish m(-3). The fish were fed three times daily with a pellet diet containing 46% protein. Twenty days old pepper seedlings were transplanted on to growth bed units of aquaponic system after stocking of carp fish for 2 months in the rearing tanks. Foliar nutrients application began 30 days after transplantation. Four treatments were used, untreated control, foliar application at the rate of 200 mL plant(-1) with 0.5 g Fe L-1 FeSO4, Fe-EDTA, and Fe-EDDHA. Plants were sprayed twice a month. The results showed that overall growth was significantly increased by foliar Fe application, and the highest values of vegetative and reproductive growth parameters were recorded in plants treated with FeSO4. The lowest chlorophyll content was observed in untreated plants. The highest SPAD index, maximal quantum yield of PS II photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and performance index (PI) values of young and old leaves were found with FeSO4, with no difference between Fe-EDTA and Fe-EDDHA treatments. The Fe treatment led to a significant increase of shoot Fe concentration in pepper plants, so that the highest shoot Fe concentration was observed in plants sprayed with Fe-sulfate, whereas Fe-EDTA and Fe-EDDHA led to intermediate concentrations and control led to the lowest one. Foliar fertilization of pepper plants with different Fe sources had a beneficial effect on the essential nutrient uptake and transport in plants. Thus, present results revealed that application of foliar Fe must be performed in the aquaponic system, to overcome Fe deficiencies in alkaline conditions and to make better nutritional status.

Experimental data were collected using a luminol chemiluminescence-based method to measure Fe(II), assuming that both the inorganic and the organically complexed species were detected. In the absence of organic matter, the data were modeled based on the Haber-Weiss mechanism with the inclusion of a back-reaction of Fe(III) with superoxide and precipitation of Fe(OH)(3). Both reactions were found to be significant using sensitivity analysis. When organic matter is present, the model was extended by organic complexation of Fe(II) and Fe(III) with the creation of a parallel oxidation pathway for Fe(II). Fe(II) oxidation at natural (nanomolar) concentrations was accurately predicted for a range of organic concentrations. The model also accounted for scavenging of superoxide by sub-nanomolar levels of dissolved copper and by organic matter when present. The presence of a relatively strong Fe(III) binding ligand was observed to significantly increase the rate of Fe(II) oxidation, while ultimately retaining most of the iron in the system in dissolved (organically complexed) form. The complexation reactions and reaction of inorganic and organically bound Fe(II) with oxygen were found to be critical reactions in the system, while Fe(III) hydrolysis became unimportant even at low organic concentrations. The superoxide radical was also observed to have a major role in the cycling of iron due to its ability to act as both an oxidant and a reductant. The model indicates that the rate constant for the reaction of Fe(II) with O-2 has generally been underestimated in previous work and that the secondary oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2 and subsequently OH. plays a relatively minor role in these systems.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Waite, TD (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,"Rose, Andrew/B-9557-2012; Waite, T.

However, the low nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) restricted its widely application. To date, many attempts have been conducted to improve its NUE. In the present study, effect of micro- and macro-nutrient addition on performance of tilapia-pak choi aquaponics was investigated. Results showed that the addition of micro- and macro-nutrients improved the growth of plant directly and facilitated fish physiology indirectly, which subsequently increased NUE of aquaponics from 40.42 to 50.64%. In addition, remarkable lower total phosphorus concentration was obtained in aquaponics with micro- and macro-nutrient addition, which was attributed to the formation of struvite. Most of the added micro-nutrients were enriched in plant root, while macro-nutrients mainly existed in water. Moreover, no enrichment of micro- and macro-nutrients in aquaponic products (i.e., fish and plant leaves) was observed, indicating that it had no influence on food safety. The findings here reported manifest that appropriate addition of micro- and macro-nutrients to aquaponics is necessary, and would improve its economic feasibility.","[Ru, Dongyun; Hu, Zhen; Zou, Yina; Jiang, Liping; Cheng, Xiaodian; Lv, Zhenting] Shandong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shandong Key Lab Water Pollut Control & Resources, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jikai] Environm Management Comm Off Dongping Lake & Nans, Jining 272000, Peoples R China",Shandong University,"Hu, Z (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shandong Key Lab Water Pollut Control & Resources, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",Huzhen885@sdu.edu.cn,"Zou, Yina/CAF-6356-2022","Zou, Yina/0000-0002-3100-3541; Hu, Zhen/0000-0002-4728-945X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21307076, 41305124]; Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University [2014TB003, 2015JC056]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University,This work received supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21307076 and 41305124) and the Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University (Nos. 2014TB003 and 2015JC056).,,33,34,36,4,105,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

To maintain a good water quality and to produce quality and healthy fishery products, the systems depend on a diverse microbial community involved in different processes of water purification but also in unwanted effects. The article reviews the present knowledge on microorganisms in RAS, their relative distribution within the system compartments and their role in system performance. The system possesses different microniches in which microorganisms retrieve their preferential conditions for oxygen and nutrients. Ammonia and nitrite are oxidized under aerobic conditions into less toxic compounds. Anaerobic ammonium oxidizers in the biofilm oxidize anaerobically both ammonia and nitrites into less harmful dinitrogen gas. Heterotrophic bacteria mineralize organic matter derived from uneaten feeds, dead bodies and excreta of fish. Under conditions of high organic load and high C/N content, nitrifiers are overgrown by heterotrophs with negative effects to the nitrification process. For not yet understood reasons, the presence of off-flavour-producing microorganisms occurs also in RAS. Microbial management and management of inputs to the systems to prevent the proliferation of pathogens are discussed and possible management techniques of off-flavours are also presented. Research orientations are given to explore further the potential of heterotrophic bacteria in microbial management and intensive aquaculture production in systems other than RAS.","[Rurangwa, Eugene] Inst Marine Resources & Ecosyst Studies IMARES, NL-4400 AB Yerseke, Netherlands; [Verdegem, Marc C.

Different types of hydroponic systems have been used for growing crops in aquaponics. However, very few studies have compared their suitability and efficiency in an aquaponic context. The study presented here compares tomato yield, morphological (external) and biochemical (internal) fruit quality, and overall tomato plant vitality from three different HP systems (nutrient film technique, drip irrigation system, and floating raft culture) and examines the distribution of nutrients in different parts of the tomato plant. Three replicate AP systems were set up, each incorporating the three different HP systems coupled with a separate recirculating aquaculture unit growing Nile tilapia. The results showed that the choice of the cultivation system had little influence on most of the above-mentioned properties. Tomato fruit mineral content was found to be in similar range for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Zn as reported in the literature. Yield and fruit quality were similar in all three systems. However, the drip irrigation system did perform slightly better. The slightly higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of the fruits grown in AP in comparison to commercially produced and supermarket derived tomatoes might indicate a potential for producing fruits with higher health value for humans.","[Schmautz, Zala; Graber, Andreas; Mathis, Alex; Junge, Ranka] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Resource Sci, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland; [Loeu, Fionna; Liebisch, Frank] ETH, Inst Agr Sci, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bulc, Tjasa Griessler] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Hlth Sci, Zdravstvena Pot 5, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Ljubljana,"Schmautz, Z; Junge, R (corresponding author), Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Nat Resource Sci, CH-8820 Wadenswil, Switzerland.",zala.schmautz@zhaw.ch; fi.loeu@gmail.com; frank.liebisch@usys.ethz.ch; fish@urbanfarmers.com; alex.mathis@zhaw.ch; tjasa.bulc@zf.uni-lj.si; ranka.junge@zhaw.ch,"Schmautz, Zala/AAV-5750-2020; Liebisch, Frank/G-5369-2011","Schmautz, Zala/0000-0003-0672-7086; Griessler Bulc, prof. dr.

A 2 x 3 factorial experiment consisting of 2 filtration regimes (unfiltered versus partially filtered pond water) and 3 aggregates (styrofoam as control, sand, and gravel). The hydroponic units were placed on a bamboo platform across the pond surface. An earthen pond (226 m(2)) was stocked with 8000 hybrid catfish with an average initial weight of 6.58 +/- 1.72 g. The fish were fed with commercial pelleted feeds containing 30% crude protein. Twenty-one days old lettuce seedlings were transplanted on to hydroponic units after stocking catfish for 4 months in the pond. Pond water was partially filtered by using a settling tank and filtration tank, which contained netting materials to trap solids. Lettuce plots were irrigated twice daily at 0800 and 1600 h using either filtered or unfiltered pond water for 45 min. The highest head weight and yield of lettuce were observed with plants grown on the sand media followed by gravel and the control treatments. Partially filtered pond water treatments had significantly higher lettuce yield (P < 0.05) and filtration increased lettuce yield of the control, gravel and sand treatments by 87, 63 and 52%, respectively, over unfiltered water treatments. Lettuce grown on gravel and the filtered water control treatments had adequate tissue N content. Nutrient rich hybrid catfish (Clarias macrocephalus x Clarias gariepinus) pond water provides an opportunity to use it in the hydroponic vegetable production. Although pond water is mainly constrained by the high suspended solids, and low dissolved oxygen, the study showed that filtration of catfish pond water enhanced the potential to use it for the hydroponic lettuce production.

In this study, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and pak choi (Brassica chinensis) culture was tested using two techniques: 1) Root floating (RAFT), and 2) Dynamic root floating (DRFT). Water quality parameters, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and phosphate were measured. At the end of the experiment, fish and plants were weighed and the required electric power consumption was calculated. There was no significant difference observed between the effect of each treatment group on either tilapia or pak choi production. Tilapia productivity was 1.69 +/- 022 kg/m3 and 1.71 +/- 0.23 kg/m3 and pak choi yield was 7.43 +/- 1.23Icg/m2 and 7.32 +/- 0.76 kg/m2 for the RAFT and DRFT, respectively. Water quality parameters were within the recommended range for the tilapia culture while pH and conductivity were out of range for the pak choi culture; nevertheless, plant production was good. Total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen did not reach concentrations that could impede tilapia growth. The DRFT allows the elimination of active aeration in hydroponic systems for tilapia and pak choi production during most of the cycle, reducing the electric power consumption to 10.3% and electricity costs to 11.4% by using a nature-based solution.

While there is anecdotal evidence, there are only a few studies on the economics of commercial aquaponics. In this study, we collect economic and production information from three aquaponic farms to investigate the economic feasibility of an aquaponics industry in Hawaii. Based on the information supplied by the farms, we develop a model case to analyze (i) profitability, (ii) return on investment, and (iii) input requirements for small-scale commercial aquaponics operation in Hawaii. We find that small-scale commercial aquaponics is economically feasible, but our findings are not as optimistic as those previously published. The modified internal rate of return of the model farm is 7.36%. We conduct sensitivity and decision reversal analysis to investigate how output prices and operational cost parameters affect the overall economic outcome. We find that economic outcome is very sensitive to output price. Investment in commercial aquaponics cannot be supported if annual sales revenue falls by 11%. We conclude by discussing challenges and risks faced by commercial aquaponic farms and the potential economic gain from organic certification and renewable energy implementation.","[Tokunaga, Kanae] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tokunaga, Kanae; Leung, PingSun] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Tamaru, Clyde; Ako, Harry] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Mol Biosci & Bioengn, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Tokunaga, K (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, 3050 Maile Way,Gilmore 111, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kanaet@hawaii.edu,,"Tokunaga, Kanae/0000-0002-6171-5187","Center for Tropical and Subtropical Aquaculture (CTSA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2011-233 (a), W-2004]","Center for Tropical and Subtropical Aquaculture (CTSA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","This study would not have been possible without the extensive support provided by Iliili Farm, Kunia Country Farm, and Mari's Gardens.

The system consisted of a Tilapia tank connected to a gravel filter and three hydroponic trenches in series with Ipomoed aquatica, Lactuca sativa and Canna glauca. The RRs influenced most water quality parameters with best water quality at the high R.R. At the low RR of 50% mass mortality of fish occurred due to lack of oxygen. The fish growth and survival was excellent in the high RR of 400% at the low fish density of 122 fish/m3. The plant trenches were found to be effective in removing potential harmful concentrations of NH4-N and NO2-N from the recirculating water. For each kg of fish produced in this system approximately 1.0 m(3) water was needed. During a 25-day period about 1 kg of marketable fresh biomass of L aquatica and 270 g dry weight aboveground biomass of C glauca was produced. It is concluded that high recirculation rate of the water of 200-400% per day is needed to secure a good growth and a low FCR of Tilapia in aquaponic systems. High recirculation rates also secure a good water quality. The aquaponic system has a very low effluent discharge compared to traditional aquaculture techniques, and it recycles nutrients for plant growth. Hence, aquaponic system is a promising sustainable solution that can be applied on commercial fish pond scale.","[Trang Ngo Thuy Diem] Can Tho Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Environm & Nat Resources, Campus 2,3-2 St, Can Tho City, Vietnam; [Konnerup, Dennis; Brix, Hans] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ole Worms Alle 1,Bldg 1135, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Can Tho University; Aarhus University,"Diem, TNT (corresponding author), Can Tho Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Environm & Nat Resources, Campus 2,3-2 St, Can Tho City, Vietnam.",ntdtrang@ctu.edu.vn,"Brix, Hans/C-5208-2008; Brix, Hans/AAN-5367-2020; Konnerup, Dennis/C-6713-2015","Brix, Hans/0000-0003-2771-2983; Brix, Hans/0000-0003-2771-2983; Konnerup, Dennis/0000-0002-9172-9221; Ngo, Trang/0000-0002-7769-2995","Cantho University - University of Aarhus Link in Environmental Science Project (CAULES); Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA); Training and Research on Physiological Constraints in Aquaculture in the Mekong Delta Region Project (PhysCAM); Faculty of Science and Technology, Aarhus University","Cantho University - University of Aarhus Link in Environmental Science Project (CAULES); Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA); Training and Research on Physiological Constraints in Aquaculture in the Mekong Delta Region Project (PhysCAM); Faculty of Science and Technology, Aarhus University","This project was funded by grants from Cantho University - University of Aarhus Link in Environmental Science Project (CAULES) funded by Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).

Today, aquaculture is imperative because fish demand is increasing. However, the load of waste is directly proportional to the fish production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more intensive fish culture with efficient systems for wastewater treatment. A number of physical, chemical and biological methods used in conventional wastewater treatment have been applied in aquaculture systems. Constructed wetlands technology is becoming more and more important in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) because wetlands have proven to be well-established and a cost-effective method for treating wastewater. This review gives an overview about possibilities to avoid the pollution of water resources; it focuses initially on the use of systems combining aquaculture and plants with a historical review of aquaculture and the treatment of its effluents. It discusses the present state, taking into account the load of pollutants in wastewater such as nitrates and phosphates, and finishes with recommendations to prevent or at least reduce the pollution of water resources in the future.","[Turcios, Ariel E.; Papenbrock, Jutta] Inst Bot, D-30419 Hannover, Germany; [Turcios, Ariel E.] Univ San Carlos, Fac Agron, Guatemala City, Guatemala",Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala,"Papenbrock, J (corresponding author), Inst Bot, Herrenhauserstr 2, D-30419 Hannover, Germany.",a.turcios@botanik.uni-hannover.de; Jutta.Papenbrock@botanik.uni-hannover.de,"Turcios, Ariel E./H-6393-2019",,Ariel Turcios by the DAAD; Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Open Access Publishing Fund of Leibniz Universitat Hannover,Ariel Turcios by the DAAD; Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publishing Fund of Leibniz Universitat Hannover,"Financial support of Ariel Turcios by the DAAD and the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala is gratefully acknowledged.

Several production systems and media exist for producing hydroponic crops (bench bed, nutrient film technique, floating raft, rockwool, perlite, and pine bark). Critical management requirements (water quality maintenance and biofilter nitrification) for aquaculture need to be integrated with the hydroponics to successfully manage intensive aquaponic systems. These systems will be discussed with emphasis on improving sustainability through management and integration of the living components [plants and nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas spp. and Nitrobacter spp.)] and the biofilter system. Sustainable opportunities include biological nitrogen production rates of 80 to 90 g.m(-3) per day nitrate nitrogen from trickling biofilters and plant uptake of aquaculture wastewater. This uptake results in improved water and nutrient use efficiency and conservation. Challenges to sustainability center around balancing the aquaponic system environment for the optimum growth of three organisms, maximizing production outputs and minimizing effluent discharges to the environment.","[Tyson, Richard V.] Orange Cty Cooperat Extens, Orlando, FL 32812 USA; [Treadwell, Danielle D.] Univ Florida, Dept Hort Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Tyson, RV (corresponding author), Orange Cty Cooperat Extens, Orlando, FL 32812 USA.",rvt@ufl.edu,,,,,,,78,149,159,6,563,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",1063-0198,1943-7714,,HORTTECHNOLOGY,HortTechnology,FEB,2011,21,1,,,,,6,13,,10.21273/HORTTECH.21.1.6,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.21.1.6,,,8,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,727AT,,Bronze,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000287770400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nitrification prevents accumulation of fish waste ammonia by converting it to NO3--N. The difference in optimum pH for hydroponic cucumber (Cucumis sativa) (5.5 to 6.0) and nitrification (7.5 to 9.0) requires reconciliation to improve systems integration and sustainability. The purpose of this investigation was to: 1) determine the ammonia biofiltration rate of a perlite trickling biofilter/root growth medium in an aquaponic system, 2) predict the relative contribution of nitrifiers and plants to ammonia biofiltration, and 3) establish the reconciling pH for ammonia biofiltration and cucumber yield in recirculating aquaponics. The biofiltration rate of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal was 19,31, and 80 g.m(-3).d(-1) for aquaponic systems [cucumber, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp. + Nitrobacter sp.)] with operating pH at 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively. With the existing aquaponic design (four plants/20 L perlite biofilter/100 L tank water), the aquaponic biofilter (with plants and nitrifiers) was three times more effective at removing TAN compared with plant uptake alone at pH 6.0. Most probable number of Nitrosomonas sp. bacteria cells sampled from biofilter cores indicated that the aquaculture control (pH 7.0) had a significantly higher (0.01% level) bacteria cell number compared with treatments containing plants in the biofilter (pH 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0). However, the highest TAN removal was with aquaponic production at pH 8.0. Thus, operating pH was more important than nitrifying bacteria population in determining the rate of ammonia biofiltration. Early marketable cucumber fruit yield decreased linearly from 1.5 to 0.7 kg/plant as pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0, but total marketable yield was not different. The reconciling pH for this system was pH 8.0, except during production for early-season cucumber market windows in which pH 7.0 would be recommended.","[Tyson, Richard V.; Simonne, Eric H.; Treadwell, Danielle D.] Univ Florida, Hort Sci Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [White, James M.] Univ Florida, Mid Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Apopka, FL 32703 USA; [Simonne, Amarat] Univ Florida, Family Youth & Community Sci Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Tyson, RV (corresponding author), Univ Florida, 250 W Cty Home Rd, Sanford, FL 32773 USA.",rvt@ufl.edu,"Simonne, Amarat/AAW-5812-2020","Simonne, Amarat/0000-0003-1695-4389",,,,,41,43,47,3,99,AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,ALEXANDRIA,"113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA",0018-5345,2327-9834,,HORTSCIENCE,Hortscience,JUN,2008,43,3,,,,,719,724,,10.21273/HORTSCI.43.3.719,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI.43.3.719,,,6,Horticulture,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,306KC,,gold,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000256245900196,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article evaluates both the technical setup as well as the economic potential of aquaponic systems and is aimed at identifying relevant knowledge questions for further improvements. Using system requirements for hydroponic systems and aquaculture, the aquaponic system was compared to a typical Dutch rockwool system. Aquaponics was found to be an improvement on current practices when using Deep Flow Technique (cultivation in a flowing thick water layer), resulting in better nutrient availability for the plants and re-use of nitrate. However, the technical challenges of the direct linkage between the two production systems in terms of needed technology and disease management was found to make the total system suboptimal when compared to conventional practices. The technological advantages of efficiency in use of land and energy and re-use of nutrients were found to be a marginal cost reduction of 1.2%. The article concludes that the added value of aquaponics can be found in the total business concept of producing in an urban environment with direct relationship with consumers. Further improvement of aquaponics can be found in improved disease management of the system - through management or improved design.","[Vermeulen, T.] Wageningen UR Greenhouse Hort, Bleiswijk, Netherlands; [Kamstra, A.] Wageningen UR Imares, Ijmuiden, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Vermeulen, T (corresponding author), Wageningen UR Greenhouse Hort, Bleiswijk, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,15,21,21,0,74,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-90-66056-36-7,ACTA HORTIC,,,2013,1004,,,,,,71,77,,,,,,7,Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,BA2UG,,,,,2023-11-27,WOS:000333917900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although ion waste production by fish cannot satisfy all plant requirements, less is known about the relationship between total feed provided for fish and the production of milliequivalents (mEq) of different macronutrients for plants, especially for nutrient flow hydroponics used for strawberry production in Spain. That knowledge is essential to consider the amount of macronutrients available in aquaculture systems so that farmers can estimate how much nutrient needs to be supplemented in the waste water from fish, to produce viable plant growth. In the present experiment, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) were grown in a small-scale recirculating system at two different densities while growth and feed consumption were noted every week for five weeks. At the same time points, water samples were taken to measure pH, EC25, HCO3-, Cl-, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, H2PO4-, SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ build up. The total increase in mEq of each ion per kg of feed provided to the fish was highest for NO3-, followed, in decreasing order, by Ca2+, H2PO4-, K+, Mg2+ and SO42-. The total amount of feed required per mEq ranged from 1.61-13.1 kg for the four most abundant ions (NO3-, Ca2+, H2PO4-, and K+) at a density of 2 kg fish m(-3), suggesting that it would be rather easy to maintain small populations of fish to reduce the cost of hydroponic solution supplementation for strawberries.","[Villarroell, M.; Alvarino, J.

However, the fate of nitrogen in aquaponic systems has not been fully understood, leading to difficulty in optimizing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and plant production. In this study, the fate of nitrogen in floating-raft aquaponic systems with two plant species, pak choi (Brassica rapa L. chinensis) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa longifolia cv. Jericho), and tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) was evaluated using mass balance and natural abundance nitrogen isotopic compositions. Dissolved oxygen (DO) levels associated with hydraulic loading rate (HLR) were found to positively affect nitrite oxidation rate. Increase in nitrite concentration was observed in recirculating water under low DO levels. Nitrite is an intermediate in the dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to N-2 gas. Based on progressive enrichment of N-15 of nitrate with time in the recirculating water, we estimated total nitrogen loss of up to 46.3% via denitrification. Nitrogen loss via denitrification was reduced by 44-56% when the feed-to-plant ratio was decreased by 30%. Results of this study provide better understanding of nitrogen transformations, which could help in designing and operating efficient aquaponic systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Aquaponics is a potential sustainable food production system that integrates aquaculture with hydroponics in which nitrogen-rich effluent from the fish production is utilized for plant growth. Because nitrogen is one of the most important inputs in an aquaponic system, it is critical to investigate the nitrogen transformations in the system for enhanced recovery of resources. Since studies on nitrogen transformations and nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) in aquaponic systems have been very limited, this review critically examines the important fates of nitrogen from input to outputs (e.g., ammonia nitrogen generation, nitrification, nitrate assimilation and nitrogen loss) to improve NUE in aquaponic systems. Various factors affecting the nitrogen transformations are also discussed. Furthermore, an example of nitrogen imbalance between nitrate uptake and nitrate generation rates in an aquaponic system was demonstrated. This review aims to advance our current understanding of nitrogen transformations and outlines future research needs in aquaponic systems, a sustainable model for efficient water and nutrient managements, and food production.

Results showed that NA and FG could improve the NUE of aquaponics by 8.8 and 16.0 %, respectively, compared with control. The total ammonia (TAN) and nitrite (NO2 (-)) concentrations in NA and FG systems were maintained at relatively low level (TAN < 0.5 mg/L, NO2 (-) < 0.1 mg/L), which demonstrated that both the NA and FG could provide non-toxic water environment for fish culture.
